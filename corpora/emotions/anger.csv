pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others  
argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two

projects more than this one."

spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always  
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I

court.   However when I arrived at the university gym the clerk  
told me that the court was being used for lessons."
7448,anger,"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that  
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's  
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I  
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so  
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is  
I was in a bad mood then)."

insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not  
say anything but just watched me leave."

grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This  
made me angry."
7504,anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not  
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt  
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost  
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not  
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
7506,anger,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played  
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell  
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right  
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to  
leave the room and go somewhere else."
