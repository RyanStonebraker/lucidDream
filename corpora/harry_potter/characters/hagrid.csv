143,harry," A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.",143,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
144,harry," No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.",144,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
145,hagrid," Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.",145,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
148,harry," Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!",148,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"

153,hagrid, A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?,153,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
155,hagrid, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!,155,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
157,hagrid," Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?",157,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
158,harry, Muggle?,158,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
159,hagrid," Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.",159,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
161,hagrid, {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.,161,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
165,harry, {laughs},165,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
166,hagrid," Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.",166,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
167,harry, {Nods} Okay.,167,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"

176,hagrid," No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.",176,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
177,tom riddle, Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.,177,1,"['harry', 'hagrid', 'tom riddle']"

185,harry," Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}",185,1,"['harry', 'hagrid', 'tom riddle']"

188,harry, Good-bye.,188,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
190,hagrid," See, Harry, you're famous!",190,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
191,harry," But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?",191,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
192,hagrid," I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}",192,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
195,hagrid," Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.",195,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
198,harry," But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.",198,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
199,hagrid," Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.",199,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
201,harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?",201,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
202,hagrid," They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.",202,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
205,hagrid," Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}",205,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
210,hagrid," Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?",210,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
213,harry," What's in there, Hagrid?",213,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
214,hagrid," Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.",214,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
216,hagrid," Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.",216,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
219,harry, I still need...a wand.,219,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
220,hagrid," A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.",220,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
222,harry, {Softly} Hello? Hello?,222,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
225,harry, Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.},225,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
227,harry," Sorry, but what's curious?",227,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
229,harry, And...who owned that wand?,229,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
232,hagrid, Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.},232,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
233,harry, Wow.,233,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
235,hagrid," You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.",235,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
236,harry," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.",236,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
237,hagrid," {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...",237,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
238,harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?,238,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
239,hagrid," No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.",239,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
240,harry, Voldemort?,240,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
241,hagrid, Shh!!,241,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
244,hagrid," It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}",244,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
245,harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?,245,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
246,hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.",246,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
247,harry, What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?,247,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
248,hagrid," Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.",248,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
251,hagrid," What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.",251,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
253,harry," Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}",253,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
257,harry," Excuse me, excuse me.",257,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
259,harry," Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?",259,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
319,hagrid," Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!",319,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
321,hagrid," Hello, Harry.",321,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
322,harry," Hey, Hagrid.",322,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
323,ron, Whoaa!,323,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
324,hagrid," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.",324,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
326,ron, Wicked.,326,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
334,harry," I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.",334,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
671,hagrid, Well done!,671,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
675,harry, Yes!,675,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
687,hagrid, What's going on with Harry's broomstick?,687,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
689,hermione, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!,689,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
690,ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?,690,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
691,hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.},691,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
693,ron," Come on, Hermione!",693,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
695,hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.,695,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
700,hagrid, Go go go!,700,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'hagrid']"
703,hagrid, Looks like he's gonna be sick!,703,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'hagrid']"
709,hagrid, Yes!,709,1,"['ron', 'hagrid']"
710,hermione, Whoo-hoo!,710,1,"['hermione', 'hagrid']"
715,hagrid, Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?,715,1,"['hermione', 'hagrid']"
716,harry, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?,716,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
717,hagrid, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?,717,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
718,ron, Fluffy?,718,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
719,hermione, That thing has a name?,719,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
720,hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the",720,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
721,harry, Yes?,721,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
722,hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.",722,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
723,harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!",723,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
724,hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,724,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
725,hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.",725,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
726,harry, Exactly.,726,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
727,hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.",727,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
728,harry, Nicholas Flamel?,728,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
729,hagrid, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.},729,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
730,harry, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?,730,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
731,hermione, I don't know.,731,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
733,harry, Knight to E-5.,733,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
736,ron, Queen to E-5.,736,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
738,hermione, That's totally barbaric!,738,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
739,ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.,739,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
812,hagrid," {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}",812,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
815,hagrid, Oh.,815,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
817,harry, We think Snape's trying to steal it.,817,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
818,hagrid," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?",818,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
819,harry," Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.",819,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
820,hagrid, Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!,820,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
821,harry, What?,821,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
822,hagrid," You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.",822,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
823,harry," Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?",823,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
824,hermione," {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.",824,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
825,hagrid," That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.",825,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
827,harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?",827,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
828,hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...,828,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
829,ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",829,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
830,hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",830,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
832,hermione, Is that...a dragon?,832,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
833,ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.,833,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
834,hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}",834,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
835,harry, Norbert?,835,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
836,hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?",836,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
837,ron, {laughs},837,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
838,hagrid," Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.",838,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
840,hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}",840,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
841,harry, Malfoy.,841,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
842,hagrid," Oh, dear.",842,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
844,harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.,844,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
845,ron," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.",845,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
846,harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?,846,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
847,ron, It's bad.,847,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
861,hagrid, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.,861,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
862,hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.",862,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
863,hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.",863,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
867,hagrid, Right. Let's go.,867,1,"['hermione', 'hagrid']"
869,harry," Hagrid, what's that?",869,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
870,hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.",870,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
871,ron, {weakly} Okay.,871,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
872,hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}",872,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
874,hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}",874,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
877,harry," If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.",877,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
880,harry," What is it, Fang?",880,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
895,hagrid," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}",895,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
899,hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",899,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
900,harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}",900,1,"['hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
901,ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?",901,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
902,harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.",902,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
903,ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!",903,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
904,hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,904,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
916,hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.,916,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
917,harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",917,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
918,hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",918,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
919,harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,919,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
920,hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",920,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
922,hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!,922,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

138,harry,(smile drooping) excuse me?,138,3,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
139,hagrid,"off yeh go! as buckbeak gallops forward, harry slides scarily back, giant wings unfold, huge and powerful, and -- whoosh! -- they soar into the air. rising higher. and higher. and higher. gradually, harry loosens his hold on buckbeak's neck. losing himself in the joy of flying. smiling at the sight of his and buckbeak's shadow racing across the grass below. circling over the whomping willow, past hogwarts castle, and then swooping, with heart-stopping speed, over the black lake, buckbeak's talons tickling the smooth glass of the water, summoning the giant squid to the surface briefly. hagrid whistles then, and buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock, galloping to a halt. as harry slides off, the class cheers -- all except draco, who narrows his eyes maliciously.",139,3,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
140,harry,"brilliant... professor. they both grin, when draco pushes past them roughly, strides toward buckbeak.",140,3,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
141,hagrid,"malfoy! no! in a flash, buckbeak's steely talons slash down. malfoy freezes. looks down at the blood blossoming on his robes. shrieks. instantly, harry dashes forward. buckbeak whips around, raises its talons and -- seeing harry -- lowers them. ducks its beak. harry... realizing what he's done... breathes.",141,3,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
142,hagrid,calm yerself! yer fine... jus' a scratch... hagrid looks: a deep gash glistens on draco's limp arm.,142,3,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
143,hagrid,"no. i'm the teacher. you all... you all just... class dismissed! and with that, hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the castle.",143,3,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
145,ron,"the little git. he's really laying it on thick, isn't he?",145,3,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

351,hagrid,"go on! you two've been at it all year. an' i'm sick o' it. acutely uncomfortable, hermione and ron step forward and perform perhaps the most awkward hug hogwarts has ever seen.",351,3,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
352,ron,"i'm not kissing fang if that's what you're thinking... hearing his name, fang -- hagrid's giant boarhound -- thumps his tail happily on the floor. hagrid turns, takes the lid from a flour tin, a tiny head, ears flecked with powder, emerges.",352,3,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
353,hagrid,"yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, ron.",353,3,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
