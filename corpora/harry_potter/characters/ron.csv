294,harry, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?,294,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
295,ron," They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!",295,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
297,harry," {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?",297,1,"['ron', 'harry']"

304,ron," Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?",304,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
305,harry, Just a little bit.,305,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
306,ron, Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?,306,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
307,harry, Yeah!,307,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
308,ron, {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-,308,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
310,hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.,310,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
311,ron, No.,311,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"

313,ron," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!",313,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
315,hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?",315,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
316,ron, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.,316,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
317,hermione," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know?

394,ron," Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!",394,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
396,hermione, Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?,396,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
398,ron, Ahh!,398,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
399,hermione, Eugh.,399,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
407,ron," Look at that one, Harry!",407,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
408,harry, I think she fancies you.,408,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
419,ron," Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?",419,1,['ron']
421,ron, That was bloody brilliant.,421,1,['ron']
423,harry, We got lost.,423,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
426,snape," There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.",426,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
428,snape," Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}",428,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
429,harry," I don't know, Sir.",429,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
430,snape, And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?,430,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
431,harry," I don't know, Sir.",431,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
437,ron," Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...",437,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
439,ron, Ah. Mail's here!,439,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
441,harry, Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.,441,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
444,hermione," I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.",444,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
446,harry," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.",446,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
457,ron," Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}",457,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
500,ron, Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in,500,1,['ron']
501,harry," A century, according to McGonagall.",501,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
504,ron," Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.",504,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
508,ron," Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}",508,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
509,harry, But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,509,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
510,hermione, You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.,510,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
512,ron," Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.",512,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
513,harry, I-I didn't know.,513,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
515,ron," I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.",515,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
516,harry, Who doesn't?,516,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
518,ron, Ahh!,518,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
519,hermione, {Gasps.},519,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
520,harry, What's happening?,520,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
521,hermione," The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}",521,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
522,harry, {taps Ron} Let's go this way.,522,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
523,ron," Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}",523,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
524,harry, Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?,524,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
525,hermione, We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.,525,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
527,harry, Let's go.,527,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
529,ron, It's Filch's cat!,529,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
530,harry, Run!,530,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
532,harry, It's locked!,532,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
533,ron," That's it, we're done for!",533,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
534,hermione," Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}",534,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
535,ron, Alohomora?,535,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
536,hermione," Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.",536,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
539,hermione, Filch is gone.,539,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
540,ron, Probably thinks this door's locked.,540,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
541,hermione, It was locked.,541,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
542,harry," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}",542,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
545,ron, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.,545,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
546,hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",546,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
547,ron," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}",547,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
548,hermione, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.,548,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
549,harry, Guarding something?,549,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
550,hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}",550,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
551,ron, She needs to sort out her priorities!,551,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
555,harry, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.},555,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
557,harry, I like this ball.,557,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
559,harry, What do I do with it?,559,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
567,ron, Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.},567,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
568,hermione," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.",568,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
569,ron," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.",569,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
571,hermione, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.},571,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
577,harry," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.",577,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
579,ron," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!",579,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
581,harry, I think she heard you.,581,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
583,harry, Where's Hermione?,583,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
588,albus dumbledore," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.",588,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
595,ron," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?",595,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
596,harry, Hermione! She doesn't know!,596,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
598,harry, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!,598,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
600,harry," Hermione, move!",600,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
602,hermione, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.},602,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
603,ron," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}",603,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
604,hermione, Ahhh! Help!,604,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
606,harry," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}",606,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
607,ron, Ew.,607,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
609,harry," Whoa, whoa whoa!",609,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
611,harry, Do something! {swipe},611,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
612,ron, What? {swipe},612,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
613,harry, Anything! Hurry up!,613,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
615,hermione, Swish and flick!,615,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
616,ron," Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.",616,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
618,hermione, Is it...dead?,618,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
619,harry, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.,619,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
624,hermione," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}",624,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
626,hermione, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.,626,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
630,ron," Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.",630,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
631,hermione," Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.",631,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
632,harry, I'm not hungry.,632,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
634,snape," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}",634,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
635,harry, That explains the blood.,635,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
636,hermione, Blood?,636,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
637,harry," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.",637,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
638,hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?,638,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
639,harry," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.",639,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
640,hermione, So you're saying...,640,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
645,ron, Let's open it.,645,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
647,harry, It's a broomstick!,647,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
648,ron," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!",648,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
649,harry, But who...?,649,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
653,harry, A little bit.,653,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
655,harry, What happened?,655,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
690,ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?,690,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
691,hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.},691,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
693,ron," Come on, Hermione!",693,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
695,hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.,695,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
698,snape," What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}",698,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape']"
699,ron, Go!,699,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape']"
700,hagrid, Go go go!,700,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'hagrid']"
703,hagrid, Looks like he's gonna be sick!,703,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'hagrid']"
709,hagrid, Yes!,709,1,"['ron', 'hagrid']"
718,ron, Fluffy?,718,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
719,hermione, That thing has a name?,719,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
720,hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the",720,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
721,harry, Yes?,721,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
722,hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.",722,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
723,harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!",723,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
724,hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,724,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
725,hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.",725,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
726,harry, Exactly.,726,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
727,hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.",727,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
728,harry, Nicholas Flamel?,728,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
736,ron, Queen to E-5.,736,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
738,hermione, That's totally barbaric!,738,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
739,ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.,739,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
740,hermione, See you haven't.,740,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
741,ron," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!",741,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
742,hermione," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.",742,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
743,ron, We've looked a hundred times!,743,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
744,hermione, Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.},744,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
745,ron, I think we've had a bad influence on her.,745,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
747,ron," {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!",747,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
749,ron," Happy Christmas, Harry.",749,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
750,harry," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?",750,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
751,ron," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!",751,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
752,harry, I've got presents?,752,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
753,ron, Yeah!,753,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
754,harry, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.},754,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
755,ron, There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.},755,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
756,harry," ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.""",756,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
758,ron, What is it?,758,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
759,harry, Some kind of...cloak.,759,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
760,ron," Well, let's see then. Put it on.",760,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
762,ron, Whoa!,762,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
763,harry, My body's gone!,763,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
764,ron, I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!,764,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
765,harry, I'm invisible??,765,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
766,ron, {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.,766,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
767,harry," {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well.""",767,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
769,harry, {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?,769,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
776,snape," You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.",776,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
785,ron, Why?,785,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
786,harry," There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!",786,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
788,harry," Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!",788,1,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
789,ron, I only see me.,789,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
790,harry," {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad",790,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
791,ron," That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?",791,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
792,harry, How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.},792,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
794,albus dumbledore," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.",794,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
795,harry," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?",795,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
796,albus dumbledore," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}",796,1,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
799,hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,799,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
800,ron, This is light?,800,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
801,hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",801,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
803,hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""",803,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
804,ron, Immortal?,804,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
805,hermione, It means you'll never die.,805,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
806,ron, I know what it means!,806,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore']"
807,harry, Shh!,807,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
808,hermione," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!""

811,harry, Hagrid!,811,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"

815,hagrid, Oh.,815,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
829,ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",829,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
830,hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",830,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
832,hermione, Is that...a dragon?,832,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
833,ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.,833,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
834,hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}",834,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
835,harry, Norbert?,835,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
836,hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?",836,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
837,ron, {laughs},837,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
838,hagrid," Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.",838,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
840,hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}",840,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
841,harry, Malfoy.,841,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
842,hagrid," Oh, dear.",842,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
844,harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.,844,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
845,ron," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.",845,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
846,harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?,846,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
847,ron, It's bad.,847,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
853,harry, 50?!,853,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
871,ron, {weakly} Okay.,871,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
872,hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}",872,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
874,hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}",874,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
877,harry," If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.",877,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
880,harry," What is it, Fang?",880,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
901,ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?",901,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
902,harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.",902,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
903,ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!",903,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
904,hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,904,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
907,hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.",907,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
908,ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?",908,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
909,harry, My scar. It keeps burning.,909,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
910,hermione, It's happened before.,910,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
911,harry, Not like this.,911,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
912,ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.,912,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
913,harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}",913,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
914,hermione, What is it?,914,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
915,harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?",915,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
916,hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.,916,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
917,harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",917,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
918,hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",918,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
919,harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,919,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
920,hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",920,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
922,hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!,922,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
941,ron," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!",941,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
943,harry," Now, Neville, listen. We were",943,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
945,hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.",945,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape', 'harry']"
947,ron," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.",947,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
948,harry, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.,948,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
949,hermione, Sorry.,949,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
950,ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}",950,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
952,hermione, Ow! You stood on my foot!,952,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
953,ron, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.},953,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
954,hermione, Alohomora.,954,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
956,ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.",956,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
957,harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.},957,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
958,ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!,958,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
959,harry, We have to move its paw.,959,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
960,ron, What?!,960,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
961,harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?",961,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
962,hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.,962,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
964,ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}",964,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
965,harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.},965,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
966,ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.",966,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
967,harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.},967,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
968,hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.",968,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
969,ron," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!",969,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
972,ron, Now what are we gonna do?!,972,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
974,harry, Hermione! Where are you?!,974,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
977,ron, Ahh! Harry!,977,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
979,ron, Harry!,979,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
980,hermione, Are you okay?,980,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
981,harry," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.",981,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
982,ron, Help!,982,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
983,hermione," He's not relaxing, is he?",983,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
984,harry, Apparently not.,984,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
985,ron, Help! Help me!,985,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
986,hermione, We've got to do something!,986,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
987,harry, What?,987,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
988,hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}",988,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
989,ron, Ahhh!,989,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
990,harry," Ron, are you okay?",990,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
991,ron, Yeah.,991,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
992,harry, Okay.,992,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
993,ron, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!,993,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
994,harry, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.,994,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
996,hermione, What is that?,996,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
997,harry, I don't know. Sounds like wings.,997,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
999,hermione, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,999,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1000,harry," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}",1000,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1001,hermione, What's this all about?,1001,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1002,harry, I don't know. Strange.,1002,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1004,ron," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.",1004,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1005,hermione, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!,1005,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1006,ron, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.,1006,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1007,harry, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.},1007,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1008,hermione," What's wrong, Harry?",1008,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1009,harry, It's too simple.,1009,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1010,ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!",1010,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1012,ron, This complicates things a bit!,1012,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1014,harry, Catch the key!,1014,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1016,ron, Hurry up!,1016,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1019,hermione, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.,1019,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1020,harry, Where are we? A graveyard.,1020,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1021,ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}",1021,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1022,harry, There's the door.,1022,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1024,hermione, Now what do we do?,1024,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1025,ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}",1025,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1026,hermione, What happens now?,1026,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1027,ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}",1027,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1028,hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?",1028,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1029,ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!",1029,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1031,ron," Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.",1031,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1032,harry, Wait a minute.,1032,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1033,ron," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.",1033,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1034,harry," No, Ron! No!",1034,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1035,hermione, What is it?,1035,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1036,harry, He's going to sacrifice himself!,1036,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1037,hermione," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!",1037,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1038,ron," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.",1038,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1040,ron, Check.,1040,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1042,ron, Ahhhh!,1042,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1043,harry," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.",1043,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1044,hermione," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.",1044,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1045,harry, Not as good as you.,1045,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"

1049,harry, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one,1049,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
1051,harry," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.",1051,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"

287,ron,"Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done.

288,albus dumbledore,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor.

444,ron,Maybe he was lying.,444,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
445,hermione,"I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald. Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.",445,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
447,harry,"You do believe me, don't you?",447,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
448,hermione,"'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified.",448,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
449,harry,"I can't explain it -- it was... scary. (frowning) D'you think I should've told them -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.",449,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
450,ron,Are you mad!,450,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
451,hermione,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.",451,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
455,hermione,"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets? A HUSH falls over the class. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger.",455,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
456,hermione,"Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing. Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement. McGonagall considers Hermione's question for a long moment, then nods. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age (CONTINUED)",456,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
459,ron,"Three glasses who? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. (a beat) According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.",459,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
460,hermione,"Muggle-borns. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Yes. Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a chamber. It has never been found.",460,2,"['ron', 'hermione']"
461,hermione,"Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin alone can control. It is said to be home... to a monster. Ron's eyes shift. Malfoy sits calmly, smiling to himself. . 63 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 63 Harry, Hermione, and Ron thread their way through the teeming corridor.

462,ron,D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?,462,2,"['ron', 'hermione']"
463,hermione,Yes. Couldn't you tell McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.,463,2,"['ron', 'hermione']"
464,harry,"But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...",464,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
465,hermione,"The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?",465,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
466,ron,(in mock puzzlement) Let's think. Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum.,466,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
467,hermione,(eyeing Malfoy ahead) If you're talking about him --,467,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
468,ron,"Of course! You heard him 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!",468,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
469,hermione,I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?,469,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
470,harry,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.",470,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
471,ron,Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...,471,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
473,hermione,"No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would be dangerous. Very dangerous.",473,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
474,ron,"When do we start? 64 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 64 In a dark nook, Harry, Ron and Hermione huddle round a book entitled Moste Potente Potions. The spotted pages are littered with DISTURBING ILLUSTRATIONS.",474,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"

478,ron,Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!,478,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
479,hermione,"Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.",479,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
480,ron,Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.,480,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
482,harry,How long will it take to make?,482,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
483,hermione,A month.,483,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
484,harry,A month? But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.,484,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"

492,hagrid,"Look fer yerself! It's bin' tampered with! Harry executes a series of zigs, zags, loops and rolls, trying to shake the Bludger, but the Bludger is relentless.

She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.",492,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
493,hermione,"You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.",493,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

754,ron,Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.,754,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
756,harry,This is a diary. And it's old...,756,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
758,ron,"It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry. Harry starts to open it... when Ron grabs his hand.",758,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
759,ron,Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.,759,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
760,harry,"I'll take my chances... (opening it) Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES! Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the ruse. At the end of corridor, Ginny stands, looking from the diary to Harry -- utter terror on her face -- then dashes off.",760,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
761,harry,Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.,761,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
762,ron,"Who doesn't? Ron frowns suddenly. On the first page on the diary, EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.",762,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
763,ron,"Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name... (thinking, then) Of course! The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room. I remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy. I must have wiped slime off his name for an hour. Harry fans the pages. They're empty.",763,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
764,harry,That's odd. He never wrote in it. 95 INT. HOSPITAL WING - LATER THAT NIGHT 95,764,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
768,hermione,Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago?,768,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
769,harry,Special Services to the School or something --,769,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
770,hermione,Fifty years ago? You're sure?,770,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
771,harry,Yes. Why?,771,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
772,hermione,Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --,772,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
773,harry,Fifty years ago! That means --,773,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
812,ron,What? What's happened...?,812,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid', 'tom riddle']"
813,harry,"It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago. 100B EXT. HOGWARTS - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY 100B CAMERA SOARS high over the castle, as below, students hurry to their classes. Finally, it FINDS",813,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid', 'tom riddle']"
815,hermione,It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.,815,2,"['hermione', 'hagrid', 'harry', 'ron', 'tom riddle']"
816,ron,"We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.",816,2,"['hermione', 'hagrid', 'harry', 'ron', 'tom riddle']"
817,harry,"The monster had killed someone, Ron. What would any of us done?",817,2,"['hermione', 'hagrid', 'harry', 'ron', 'tom riddle']"
818,hermione,Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it?,818,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
820,ron,"That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?",820,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
821,hagrid,"Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh? The trio wheels, spots Hagrid grinning at them. They instantly look guilty.",821,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
822,harry,No! Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.,822,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
823,ron,No! Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.,822,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
824,hermione,No! Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.,822,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
825,harry,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?",825,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
826,hagrid,"Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer the Mandrakes, yeh know. Accordin' ter Professor Sprout, they still got a bit o' growin' up ter do, but once their acne clears up, we'll be able to chop 'em up, stew 'em, an' get those people in the hospital un-Petrified. 'Til then, you three best watch yerselves, all righ'? They nod, watch Hagrid lope away. Just then, Neville comes running up. He looks pale with fright.",826,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
829,hermione,"It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it wasn't a student...",829,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
831,ron,"Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.",831,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
832,harry,"And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone. 105 EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY 105 Students stream into the Quidditch Stadium. 105A INT.

833,ron,"Hey, Ginny! Going to the match? Ginny looks up, startled, then shakes her head and exits.",833,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
834,ron,"I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day... VOICE (O.S.) Kill this time... Let me rip... Tear. Harry freezes. Ron and Hermione stop, knowing by his face...",834,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
835,ron,"No... don't tell me... Harry turns, as if following the SOUND, absently touching his fingers to the wall as he glances around. Hermione studies him with great interest -- STUDIES HIS FINGERS -- then, abruptly, Harry turns away, shakes his head it's gone. Hermione looks up, eyes vaguely upon Harry, but her mind miles away.",835,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
836,hermione,"Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library! As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS.",836,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
837,harry,What do you understand!,837,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
840,harry,The library?,840,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
841,ron,"That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library 106 EXT. REAR OF QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY (LATER) 106 Harry and his teammates march toward the Quidditch tower. The CHEERS of the CROWD are heard.",841,2,"['ron', 'hermione', 'harry']"
849,ron,"Hermione! PROFESSOR McGONAGALL She was found near the library. Along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you? She holds up a SMALL CIRCULAR MIRROR. Harry shakes his head. McGonagall nods gravely, leads them out. As they go, the CAMERA DRIFTS to HERMIONE'S HAND. Clinched tight in her stiff knuckles, barely visible, is... a PIECE OF PAPER. 108 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 108 McGonagall reads from a PARCHMENT to the somber Gryffindors. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock in the evening. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. (rolling up the parchment) I should tell you all this. Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely that the school will be closed. McGonagall turns, exits. Instantly, as one, the students begin to talk amongst themselves. Neville speaks up.",849,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
854,harry,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. And that's a start.",854,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
855,ron,But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --,855,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
856,harry,I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again. 109 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (LATER) 109,856,2,"['ron', 'harry']"

863,hagrid,"Nothin', nothin'. I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit down... I'll make tea... Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..",863,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
864,harry,Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?,864,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
865,hagrid,"Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'.",865,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
871,ron,(whispering to Harry) That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge. The Minister of Magic! Harry elbows Ron to shut him up.,871,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
873,hagrid,"I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...",873,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

876,hagrid,Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.,876,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
879,hagrid,What're you doin' here! Get outta my house!,879,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
893,ron,"Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.",893,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
894,harry,"Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.",894,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
895,harry,C'mon. 103.,895,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
898,ron,What are you doing?,898,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
899,harry,You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.,899,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
900,ron,"They're heading into the Dark Forest. Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang, follows.",900,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
901,ron,Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?,901,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
903,harry,"There's something moving over there... something big. Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding them. They start to flee... when Ron stops.",903,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
904,ron,"Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.",904,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
906,harry,"It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild. Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.",906,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
907,harry,"C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail. 121A EXT. SPIDERS' HOLLOW - NIGHT 121A Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows. Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off queasily. Harry peers up ahead at the far end of the hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING. As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about nervously.",907,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
908,ron,"I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --",908,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
909,harry,"Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.",909,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
912,harry,"(breathing finally) Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... (as it comes to him) ... Aragog, aren't you?",912,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
916,harry,"He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then... RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left. Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.",916,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
918,harry,But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.,918,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
920,ron,Harry...,920,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
921,harry,"Shhh! (to Aragog) But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?",921,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
923,harry,But have you seen it?,923,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
927,harry,(annoyed) What! Ron points. Harry looks. Pales. Turns slowly back to Aragog.,927,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
928,harry,Well... thank you. We'll just go...,928,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
930,ron,"Can we panic now? CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again SPIDERS. Everywhere. CLOSING IN. Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand. The spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of the LIGHT chases itself away. Around and around. Then The LANTERN goes out. Harry pitches it aside. As one, he and Ron draw their wands.",930,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
931,ron,Nice knowing you.,931,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
934,harry,"Let's go! Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY. A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.",934,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
935,harry,THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!,935,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
936,ron,"(trying) I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK! Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window. Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE. Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows hold tight. As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his SPIDER'S LEGS. 121B EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT 121B The Anglia jets out of the hollow, lands with a THUD. Harry turns. The other spider is PULLING RON from the car. Harry points his wand, utters a spell and a BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT BLASTS the spider into the shadows whipping past.",936,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
937,ron,Thanks for that.,937,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
939,harry,"Don't mention it. They stop. Both hear it a DISTANT CLICKING. As the car flies over a ridge, they see them a SEA OF SPIDERS heading straight for them like a herd of raging wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders STAMPEDE after. 121C EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK - NIGHT 121C The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead, SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one narrow escape route.",939,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
940,harry,That way! It's the only way out! (looking back) Hurry! They're catching up! Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as good as dead.,940,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
941,harry,Can you get us in the air?,941,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
942,ron,"(jostling the gear stick) Flying gear's jammed! The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing tarantula, then sails over the trees. 121D EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 121D As they LAND, Fang bolts free. Harry and Ron exit the CAR wearily, then watch it turn and RUMBLE BACK INTO THE FOREST.",942,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
944,ron,"'Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?",944,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
945,harry,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.,945,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
949,ron,"We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it? A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.",949,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
951,ron,"You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? (off Harry's look) Right. Forget I said it.",951,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
954,harry,"Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched there. 124 INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER) 124 Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.",954,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
955,harry,"'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' (looking up) Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.",955,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
956,ron,"But it kills by looking people in the eye. Why is it no one's dead? Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters HARRY",956,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
957,harry,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least... (in a rush) Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again... (CONTINUED)",957,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
960,ron,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.",960,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
961,harry,The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... (scanning the page again) The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits!,961,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
962,ron,But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...,962,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
963,harry,"Hermione answered that too. Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is ""Pipes.""",963,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
964,ron,(aghast) Pipes...? It's using the plumbing.,964,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
965,harry,Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.,965,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
966,ron,"Moaning Myrtle! Harry nods. Just then, McGonagall's VOICE ECHOES throughout the castle, magically magnified.",966,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
970,snape,"Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.",970,2,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
972,snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?,972,2,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
977,ron,"She knew something, Harry. She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That's why she was taken. I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood. There can't be any other reason.",977,2,"['ron', 'snape']"
978,harry,"(pulling him away) C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...",978,2,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
979,ron,"Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know -- Harry glances over, studies Ron's tortured eyes.",979,2,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
980,harry,"We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.",980,2,"['ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
984,harry,"Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead. Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves. Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.",984,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
985,harry,Are you going somewhere?,985,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
987,ron,What about my sister?,987,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
989,ron,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!,989,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
992,harry,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?,992,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
994,harry,You wrote them!,994,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
996,harry,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!,996,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
998,ron,Is there anything you can do?,998,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1001,harry,"Expelliarmus! Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open trunks, his wand flying across the floor.",1001,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1002,harry,"Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.",1002,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1005,harry,To ask you how you died.,1005,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1007,harry,"Who was it, Myrtle?",1007,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1013,ron,"Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue. Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.",1013,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1014,harry,Open up. Ron shakes his head. Harry's spoken in his regular voice.,1014,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1015,ron,"English. Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensely that the snake almost looks alive. When, finally, he speaks, it is more like a HISS. Parseltongue. The circular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE is exposed.",1015,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1017,harry,"Oh, yes there is. You first. Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.",1017,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1019,ron,A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.,1019,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1022,harry,All right. Let's go.,1022,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1024,harry,"Thanks, Myrtle. Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows. 131 INT. PIPE - NIGHT 131 Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the damp floor of a stone tunnel. 132 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 132 Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his robes. Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his wand.",1024,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1025,harry,Lumos! The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.,1025,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1026,harry,"Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They look down a rat's skull. All around them, the ground is littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks, his voice is hollow with dread.",1026,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1028,ron,What's that? Up ahead?,1028,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1030,harry,"Maybe it's asleep. Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY SKIN.",1030,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1031,ron,Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more. THUD! They turn. Lockhart has passed out.,1031,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1032,ron,"Heart of a lion, this one. Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and, quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to his feet.",1032,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1034,harry,Ron? Are you okay?,1034,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1036,ron,"I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. Lockhart sits up, dazed. Ron picks up a rock and CONKS him on the head. Lockhart PASSES OUT. Ron calls to Harry.",1036,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1037,ron,What now?,1037,2,"['ron', 'harry']"

Along the path are rows of STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of black water. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN. Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies motionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms, her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble. A pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest. Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on the floor and kneels beside her.

1125,albus dumbledore,"Ingenious. Simply... ingenious. (looking up) Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught him myself fifty years ago. After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped.

1139,albus dumbledore,"Therefore, it seems only fitting... (eyes twinkling) That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.

1144,albus dumbledore,"First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?",1144,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1145,harry,"It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.",1145,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1147,albus dumbledore,"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",1147,2,"['ron', 'albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
