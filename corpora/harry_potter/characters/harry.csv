201,harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?",201,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
202,hagrid," They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.",202,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
205,hagrid," Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}",205,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"

219,harry, I still need...a wand.,219,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"

237,hagrid," {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...",237,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
238,harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?,238,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"

240,harry, Voldemort?,240,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
241,hagrid, Shh!!,241,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
244,hagrid," It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}",244,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
245,harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?,245,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
246,hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.",246,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
247,harry, What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?,247,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
248,hagrid," Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.",248,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
251,hagrid," What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.",251,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
253,harry," Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}",253,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
257,harry," Excuse me, excuse me.",257,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
259,harry," Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?",259,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
263,harry, Muggles?,263,1,['harry']

286,ron, Wicked.,286,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
289,ron," {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}",289,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
290,harry, {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!,290,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
291,ron, Whoa!,291,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
294,harry, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?,294,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
295,ron," They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!",295,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
297,harry," {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?",297,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
298,ron," It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.",298,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
300,ron," Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.",300,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
301,harry," Hey, I got Dumbledore!",301,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
302,ron, I got about 6 of him.,302,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
303,harry," Hey, he's gone!",303,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
304,ron," Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?",304,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
305,harry, Just a little bit.,305,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
306,ron, Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?,306,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
307,harry, Yeah!,307,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
308,ron, {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-,308,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
310,hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.,310,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
311,ron, No.,311,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
312,hermione," Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.",312,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
313,ron," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!",313,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
315,hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?",315,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
316,ron, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.,316,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
317,hermione," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}",317,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
322,harry," Hey, Hagrid.",322,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
323,ron, Whoaa!,323,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
324,hagrid," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.",324,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
326,ron, Wicked.,326,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
334,harry," I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.",334,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
338,hermione," It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.",338,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
341,albus dumbledore," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.",341,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"

363,ron, {Sighs},363,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
368,harry, {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.,368,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
373,albus dumbledore, Let the feast...begin.,373,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
375,harry, Wow.,375,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
382,harry," Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?",382,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
384,harry, What's he teach?,384,1,['harry']
387,ron, Ahh!,387,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
394,ron," Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!",394,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
408,harry, I think she fancies you.,408,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
423,harry, We got lost.,423,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
426,snape," There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.",426,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
428,snape," Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}",428,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
429,harry," I don't know, Sir.",429,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
430,snape, And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?,430,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
431,harry," I don't know, Sir.",431,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
432,snape," Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?",432,1,"['snape', 'harry']"
436,harry, What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?,436,1,"['snape', 'harry']"
437,ron," Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...",437,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'ron']"

441,harry, Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.,441,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'ron']"

446,harry," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.",446,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

540,ron, Probably thinks this door's locked.,540,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
541,hermione, It was locked.,541,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
542,harry," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}",542,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
545,ron, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.,545,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
546,hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",546,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
547,ron," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}",547,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
548,hermione, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.,548,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
549,harry, Guarding something?,549,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
550,hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}",550,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
551,ron, She needs to sort out her priorities!,551,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
555,harry, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.},555,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
557,harry, I like this ball.,557,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

562,harry, Whoa.,562,1,['harry']
567,ron, Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.},567,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
568,hermione," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.",568,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
569,ron," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.",569,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
571,hermione, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.},571,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
577,harry," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.",577,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
579,ron," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!",579,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
581,harry, I think she heard you.,581,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
583,harry, Where's Hermione?,583,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
588,albus dumbledore," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.",588,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
594,harry, How could a troll get in?,594,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
595,ron," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?",595,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
596,harry, Hermione! She doesn't know!,596,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
598,harry, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!,598,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
600,harry," Hermione, move!",600,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
602,hermione, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.},602,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
603,ron," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}",603,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
604,hermione, Ahhh! Help!,604,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
606,harry," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}",606,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
607,ron, Ew.,607,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
609,harry," Whoa, whoa whoa!",609,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
611,harry, Do something! {swipe},611,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
612,ron, What? {swipe},612,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
613,harry, Anything! Hurry up!,613,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
615,hermione, Swish and flick!,615,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
616,ron," Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.",616,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
618,hermione, Is it...dead?,618,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
619,harry, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.,619,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
624,hermione," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}",624,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
626,hermione, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.,626,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
632,harry, I'm not hungry.,632,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
634,snape," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}",634,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
635,harry, That explains the blood.,635,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
636,hermione, Blood?,636,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
637,harry," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.",637,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
638,hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?,638,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
639,harry," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.",639,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
640,hermione, So you're saying...,640,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
641,harry, That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.,641,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
643,hermione," Bit early for mail, isn't it?",643,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
644,harry, But I-I never get mail.,644,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
645,ron, Let's open it.,645,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
647,harry, It's a broomstick!,647,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
648,ron," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!",648,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
649,harry, But who...?,649,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
653,harry, A little bit.,653,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
655,harry, What happened?,655,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
669,harry, Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!,669,1,['harry']
671,hagrid, Well done!,671,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
675,harry, Yes!,675,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
686,harry, Whoa! Whooa!,686,1,['harry']
687,hagrid, What's going on with Harry's broomstick?,687,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
689,hermione, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!,689,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
690,ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?,690,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
691,hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.},691,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
693,ron," Come on, Hermione!",693,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
695,hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.,695,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
716,harry, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?,716,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
717,hagrid, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?,717,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
718,ron, Fluffy?,718,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
719,hermione, That thing has a name?,719,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
720,hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the",720,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
721,harry, Yes?,721,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
722,hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.",722,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
723,harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!",723,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
724,hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,724,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
725,hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.",725,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
726,harry, Exactly.,726,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
727,hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.",727,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
728,harry, Nicholas Flamel?,728,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
729,hagrid, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.},729,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
730,harry, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?,730,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
731,hermione, I don't know.,731,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
733,harry, Knight to E-5.,733,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
736,ron, Queen to E-5.,736,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
738,hermione, That's totally barbaric!,738,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
739,ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.,739,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
740,hermione, See you haven't.,740,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
741,ron," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!",741,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
742,hermione," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.",742,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
743,ron, We've looked a hundred times!,743,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
750,harry," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?",750,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
751,ron," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!",751,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
752,harry, I've got presents?,752,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
753,ron, Yeah!,753,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
754,harry, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.},754,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
755,ron, There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.},755,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
756,harry," ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.""",756,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
758,ron, What is it?,758,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
759,harry, Some kind of...cloak.,759,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
760,ron," Well, let's see then. Put it on.",760,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
762,ron, Whoa!,762,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
763,harry, My body's gone!,763,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
764,ron, I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!,764,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
765,harry, I'm invisible??,765,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
766,ron, {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.,766,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
767,harry," {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well.""",767,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
769,harry, {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?,769,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
776,snape," You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.",776,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
778,snape," You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.",778,1,"['snape', 'harry']"
782,harry," Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.",782,1,"['snape', 'harry']"
784,harry," Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!",784,1,"['snape', 'harry']"
785,ron, Why?,785,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'ron']"
786,harry," There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!",786,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'ron']"
788,harry," Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!",788,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'ron']"
789,ron, I only see me.,789,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
790,harry," {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad",790,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
791,ron," That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?",791,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
792,harry, How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.},792,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
794,albus dumbledore," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.",794,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
795,harry," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?",795,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
796,albus dumbledore," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}",796,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
799,hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,799,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
800,ron, This is light?,800,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
801,hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",801,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
803,hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""",803,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
804,ron, Immortal?,804,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
805,hermione, It means you'll never die.,805,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
807,harry, Shh!,807,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
808,hermione," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!",808,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
811,harry, Hagrid!,811,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

815,hagrid, Oh.,815,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
817,harry, We think Snape's trying to steal it.,817,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
818,hagrid," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?",818,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
819,harry," Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.",819,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
820,hagrid, Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!,820,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
821,harry, What?,821,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
822,hagrid," You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.",822,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
823,harry," Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?",823,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
824,hermione," {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.",824,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
825,hagrid," That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.",825,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
827,harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?",827,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
828,hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...,828,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
829,ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",829,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
830,hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",830,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
832,hermione, Is that...a dragon?,832,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
833,ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.,833,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
834,hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}",834,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
835,harry, Norbert?,835,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
836,hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?",836,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

840,hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}",840,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
841,harry, Malfoy.,841,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
842,hagrid," Oh, dear.",842,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
844,harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.,844,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
845,ron," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.",845,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
846,harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?,846,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
847,ron, It's bad.,847,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
853,harry, 50?!,853,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
861,hagrid, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.,861,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
862,hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.",862,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
863,hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.",863,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
869,harry," Hagrid, what's that?",869,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
870,hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.",870,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
871,ron, {weakly} Okay.,871,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
872,hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}",872,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
874,hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}",874,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

880,harry," What is it, Fang?",880,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
886,harry, {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?,886,1,['harry']
888,harry, But who would choose such a life?,888,1,['harry']
890,harry, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?,890,1,['harry']
892,harry, The Philosopher's Stone.,892,1,['harry']
894,hermione, Harry!,894,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
895,hagrid," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}",895,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
899,hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",899,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
900,harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}",900,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
901,ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?",901,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
902,harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.",902,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
903,ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!",903,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
904,hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,904,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
907,hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.",907,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
908,ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?",908,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
909,harry, My scar. It keeps burning.,909,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
910,hermione, It's happened before.,910,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
911,harry, Not like this.,911,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
912,ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.,912,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
913,harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}",913,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
914,hermione, What is it?,914,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
915,harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?",915,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
916,hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.,916,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
917,harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",917,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
918,hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",918,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
919,harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,919,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
920,hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",920,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
922,hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!,922,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
924,harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!",924,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
926,harry, He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.,926,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
928,harry, Someone's going to try and steal it.,928,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
931,harry," That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.",931,1,"['harry', 'hagrid']"
932,hermione, And with Dumbledore gone,932,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
934,snape," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?",934,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
935,hermione, Uh...we were just...,935,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
936,snape," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}",936,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
937,hermione, Now what do we do?,937,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
938,harry, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.,938,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
940,harry, Trevor.,940,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
941,ron," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!",941,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione', 'ron']"
943,harry," Now, Neville, listen. We were",943,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione', 'ron']"
945,hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.",945,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione', 'ron']"
947,ron," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.",947,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
948,harry, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.,948,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
949,hermione, Sorry.,949,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
950,ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}",950,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
952,hermione, Ow! You stood on my foot!,952,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
953,ron, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.},953,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
954,hermione, Alohomora.,954,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
956,ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.",956,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
957,harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.},957,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
958,ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!,958,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
959,harry, We have to move its paw.,959,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
960,ron, What?!,960,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
961,harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?",961,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
962,hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.,962,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
964,ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}",964,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
965,harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.},965,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
966,ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.",966,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
967,harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.},967,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
968,hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.",968,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
969,ron," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!",969,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
972,ron, Now what are we gonna do?!,972,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
974,harry, Hermione! Where are you?!,974,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
977,ron, Ahh! Harry!,977,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
979,ron, Harry!,979,1,"['ron', 'harry']"
980,hermione, Are you okay?,980,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
981,harry," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.",981,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
982,ron, Help!,982,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
983,hermione," He's not relaxing, is he?",983,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
984,harry, Apparently not.,984,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
985,ron, Help! Help me!,985,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
986,hermione, We've got to do something!,986,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
987,harry, What?,987,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
988,hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}",988,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
989,ron, Ahhh!,989,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
990,harry," Ron, are you okay?",990,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
991,ron, Yeah.,991,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
992,harry, Okay.,992,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
993,ron, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!,993,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
994,harry, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.,994,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
996,hermione, What is that?,996,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
997,harry, I don't know. Sounds like wings.,997,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
999,hermione, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,999,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1000,harry," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}",1000,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1001,hermione, What's this all about?,1001,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1002,harry, I don't know. Strange.,1002,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1004,ron," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.",1004,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1005,hermione, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!,1005,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1006,ron, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.,1006,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1007,harry, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.},1007,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1008,hermione," What's wrong, Harry?",1008,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1009,harry, It's too simple.,1009,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1010,ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!",1010,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1012,ron, This complicates things a bit!,1012,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1014,harry, Catch the key!,1014,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1016,ron, Hurry up!,1016,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1019,hermione, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.,1019,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1020,harry, Where are we? A graveyard.,1020,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1021,ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}",1021,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1022,harry, There's the door.,1022,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1024,hermione, Now what do we do?,1024,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1025,ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}",1025,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1026,hermione, What happens now?,1026,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1027,ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}",1027,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1028,hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?",1028,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1029,ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!",1029,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1031,ron," Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.",1031,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1032,harry, Wait a minute.,1032,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1033,ron," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.",1033,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1034,harry," No, Ron! No!",1034,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1035,hermione, What is it?,1035,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1036,harry, He's going to sacrifice himself!,1036,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1037,hermione," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!",1037,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1038,ron," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.",1038,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1040,ron, Check.,1040,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1042,ron, Ahhhh!,1042,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1043,harry," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.",1043,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1044,hermione," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.",1044,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1045,harry, Not as good as you.,1045,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1046,hermione," {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.",1046,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1049,harry, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one,1049,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1051,harry," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.",1051,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1053,harry, Snape was trying to...save me?,1053,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
1055,harry, Th-then you let the troll in.,1055,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
1063,harry, I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.,1063,1,['harry']
1069,harry, Voldemort.,1069,1,['harry']
1073,harry, {shakes his head} Never!,1073,1,['harry']
1075,harry, You liar!,1075,1,['harry']
1083,harry," Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}",1083,1,['harry']
1085,albus dumbledore," Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?",1085,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1086,harry, Admirers?,1086,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1087,albus dumbledore," What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.",1087,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1088,harry, Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?,1088,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1089,albus dumbledore, Fine. They're both just fine.,1089,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1090,harry," But, what happened to the Stone?",1090,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1091,albus dumbledore," Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.",1091,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1092,harry," But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?",1092,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1093,albus dumbledore," {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.",1093,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1094,harry," How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...",1094,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1095,albus dumbledore," Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}",1095,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1096,harry," Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?",1096,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1097,albus dumbledore," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.",1097,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1098,harry, What is it?,1098,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1099,albus dumbledore," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.",1099,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1101,harry," All right there, Ron?",1101,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1102,ron, All right? You?,1102,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1103,harry, {shrug} All right. Hermione?,1103,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1104,hermione, {smile} Never better.,1104,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1108,albus dumbledore," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.",1108,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1112,albus dumbledore," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}",1112,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1113,harry, {Pats} Good job.,1113,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1114,albus dumbledore," Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}",1114,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1115,hermione, We're tied with Slytherin!,1115,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1116,albus dumbledore," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.",1116,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1118,albus dumbledore," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!",1118,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1120,hagrid, Yes! {grins},1120,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1129,harry, One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.},1129,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

1132,harry," Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}",1132,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1133,hagrid," Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.",1133,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1134,harry," But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.",1134,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1135,hagrid," I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.",1135,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1137,hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?",1137,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1138,harry, I'm not going home. Not really.,1138,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

374,hagrid,"He didn'! Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then away, obviously pained by this.",374,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
375,hermione,It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone... like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.,375,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
376,hagrid,"Yeh see, Harry. There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.",376,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
377,harry,That's horrible.,377,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

410,ron,What's that? Hanging underneath?,410,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
411,harry,"That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris. The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket, eyes open and blank. Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent WINDOW near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up a silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the glass.",411,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

413,ron,"(backing away) I... don't... like... spiders. Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, seconds later, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING... when they stop, seeing the wall and, standing before it, Harry, Ron and Hermione.

439,ron,"A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course.

443,harry,He said he didn't.,443,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

456,hermione,"Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing. Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement. McGonagall considers Hermione's question for a long moment, then nods. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age (CONTINUED)",456,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
459,ron,"Three glasses who? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. (a beat) According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.",459,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

478,ron,Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!,478,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
479,hermione,"Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.",479,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

736,hermione,And has it gotten any better? I mean... is anyone speaking to you?,736,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
737,harry,Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday. I suppose that's something. Ron takes a GET-WELL CARD from under Hermione's pillow.,737,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
738,ron,"'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow?",738,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

752,harry,Who threw it at you anyway?,752,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
754,ron,Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.,754,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
756,harry,This is a diary. And it's old...,756,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
758,ron,"It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry. Harry starts to open it... when Ron grabs his hand.",758,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
759,ron,Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.,759,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
760,harry,"I'll take my chances... (opening it) Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES! Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the ruse. At the end of corridor, Ginny stands, looking from the diary to Harry -- utter terror on her face -- then dashes off.",760,2,"['ron', 'harry']"

763,ron,"Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name... (thinking, then) Of course! The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room.

764,harry,That's odd. He never wrote in it. 95 INT. HOSPITAL WING - LATER THAT NIGHT 95,764,2,"['ron', 'harry']"

771,harry,Yes. Why?,771,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
772,hermione,Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --,772,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
773,harry,Fifty years ago! That means --,773,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
774,hermione,"Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened. What if he wrote about what he saw? It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it. If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?",774,2,"['harry', 'hermione']"
775,harry,"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.",775,2,"['harry', 'hermione']"
776,hermione,"It might be invisible ink. (pulls out her wand) Aparecium! She taps the diary three times. Nothing happens. The pages remain BLANK. She frowns, passes the book back to Harry.",776,2,"['harry', 'hermione']"
778,hermione,"I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous.",778,2,"['harry', 'hermione']"
779,harry,"You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione? I mean, you're not scared. Of me.",779,2,"['harry', 'hermione']"

900,ron,"They're heading into the Dark Forest. Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang, follows.",900,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
901,ron,Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?,901,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
903,harry,"There's something moving over there... something big. Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding them. They start to flee... when Ron stops.",903,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
904,ron,"Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.",904,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
906,harry,"It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild. Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.",906,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
907,harry,"C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail. 121A EXT. SPIDERS' HOLLOW - NIGHT 121A Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows. Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off queasily. Harry peers up ahead at the far end of the hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING. As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about nervously.",907,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
908,ron,"I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --",908,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
909,harry,"Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.",909,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
912,harry,"(breathing finally) Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... (as it comes to him) ... Aragog, aren't you?",912,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
916,harry,"He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then... RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left. Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.",916,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
918,harry,But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.,918,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
920,ron,Harry...,920,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
921,harry,"Shhh! (to Aragog) But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?",921,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
923,harry,But have you seen it?,923,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
927,harry,(annoyed) What! Ron points. Harry looks. Pales. Turns slowly back to Aragog.,927,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
928,harry,Well... thank you. We'll just go...,928,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
930,ron,"Can we panic now? CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again SPIDERS. Everywhere. CLOSING IN. Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand. The spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of the LIGHT chases itself away. Around and around. Then The LANTERN goes out. Harry pitches it aside. As one, he and Ron draw their wands.",930,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
931,ron,Nice knowing you.,931,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
934,harry,"Let's go! Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY. A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.",934,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
935,harry,THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!,935,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
936,ron,"(trying) I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK! Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window. Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE. Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows hold tight. As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his SPIDER'S LEGS. 121B EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT 121B The Anglia jets out of the hollow, lands with a THUD. Harry turns. The other spider is PULLING RON from the car. Harry points his wand, utters a spell and a BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT BLASTS the spider into the shadows whipping past.",936,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
937,ron,Thanks for that.,937,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
939,harry,"Don't mention it. They stop. Both hear it a DISTANT CLICKING. As the car flies over a ridge, they see them a SEA OF SPIDERS heading straight for them like a herd of raging wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders STAMPEDE after. 121C EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK - NIGHT 121C The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead, SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one narrow escape route.",939,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
940,harry,That way! It's the only way out! (looking back) Hurry! They're catching up! Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as good as dead.,940,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
941,harry,Can you get us in the air?,941,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
942,ron,"(jostling the gear stick) Flying gear's jammed! The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing tarantula, then sails over the trees. 121D EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 121D As they LAND, Fang bolts free. Harry and Ron exit the CAR wearily, then watch it turn and RUMBLE BACK INTO THE FOREST.",942,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
944,ron,"'Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?",944,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
945,harry,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.,945,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
949,ron,"We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it? A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.",949,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
951,ron,"You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? (off Harry's look) Right. Forget I said it.",951,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
954,harry,"Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched there. 124 INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER) 124 Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.",954,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
955,harry,"'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' (looking up) Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.",955,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
956,ron,"But it kills by looking people in the eye. Why is it no one's dead? Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters HARRY",956,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
957,harry,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least... (in a rush) Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again... (CONTINUED)",957,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
960,ron,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.",960,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
961,harry,The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... (scanning the page again) The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits!,961,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
962,ron,But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...,962,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
963,harry,"Hermione answered that too. Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is ""Pipes.""",963,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
964,ron,(aghast) Pipes...? It's using the plumbing.,964,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
965,harry,Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.,965,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
966,ron,"Moaning Myrtle! Harry nods. Just then, McGonagall's VOICE ECHOES throughout the castle, magically magnified.",966,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
970,snape,"Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.",970,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
972,snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?,972,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
978,harry,"(pulling him away) C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...",978,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
979,ron,"Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know -- Harry glances over, studies Ron's tortured eyes.",979,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
980,harry,"We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.",980,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
984,harry,"Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead. Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves. Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.",984,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
985,harry,Are you going somewhere?,985,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
987,ron,What about my sister?,987,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
989,ron,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!,989,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
992,harry,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?,992,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
994,harry,You wrote them!,994,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
996,harry,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!,996,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
998,ron,Is there anything you can do?,998,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1001,harry,"Expelliarmus! Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open trunks, his wand flying across the floor.",1001,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1002,harry,"Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.",1002,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1005,harry,To ask you how you died.,1005,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1007,harry,"Who was it, Myrtle?",1007,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1009,harry,Just like that? How?,1009,2,['harry']
1012,harry,"This is it, Ron. This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.",1012,2,['harry']
1013,ron,"Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue. Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.",1013,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1014,harry,Open up. Ron shakes his head. Harry's spoken in his regular voice.,1014,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1015,ron,"English. Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensely that the snake almost looks alive. When, finally, he speaks, it is more like a HISS. Parseltongue. The circular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE is exposed.",1015,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1017,harry,"Oh, yes there is. You first. Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.",1017,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1019,ron,A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.,1019,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1022,harry,All right. Let's go.,1022,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1024,harry,"Thanks, Myrtle. Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows. 131 INT. PIPE - NIGHT 131 Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the damp floor of a stone tunnel. 132 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 132 Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his robes. Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his wand.",1024,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1025,harry,Lumos! The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.,1025,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1026,harry,"Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They look down a rat's skull. All around them, the ground is littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks, his voice is hollow with dread.",1026,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1028,ron,What's that? Up ahead?,1028,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1030,harry,"Maybe it's asleep. Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY SKIN.",1030,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1031,ron,Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more. THUD! They turn. Lockhart has passed out.,1031,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1032,ron,"Heart of a lion, this one. Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and, quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to his feet.",1032,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1034,harry,Ron? Are you okay?,1034,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1036,ron,"I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. Lockhart sits up, dazed. Ron picks up a rock and CONKS him on the head. Lockhart PASSES OUT. Ron calls to Harry.",1036,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1037,ron,What now?,1037,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1038,harry,Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not back in an hour... He leaves it there.,1038,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1039,ron,"I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry --",1039,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1040,harry,"See you in a bit. Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off. He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.",1040,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1041,harry,"(Parseltongue) Open. The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN. Harry removes his wand and ENTERS. 133 INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133 A vast chamber stretches ahead. Along the path are rows of STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of black water. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN. Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies motionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms, her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble. A pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest. Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on the floor and kneels beside her. (BOLD ITALICS INDICATE POSSIBLE FLASHBACKS.)",1041,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1042,harry,Ginny! Please don't be dead. Wake up! Wake up! Ginny!,1042,2,"['ron', 'harry']"
1044,tom riddle,"She won't wake. Harry spins. Tom Riddle stands nearby. He is strangely BLURRED around the edges, as though Harry was looking at him through a misted window.",1044,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
1045,harry,"Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...",1045,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
1046,tom riddle,She's still alive. But only just.,1046,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
1047,harry,Are you a ghost?,1047,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
1048,tom riddle,"A memory. Preserved in a diary for fifty years. Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his own hand on Ginny's arm.",1048,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
1049,harry,"She's cold as ice. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk --",1049,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
1050,tom riddle,"It won't come until it's called. Harry looks up, sees Riddle twirling a wand in his fingers.",1050,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1051,harry,"Give me my wand, Tom.",1051,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1052,tom riddle,You won't be needing it.,1052,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1053,harry,"Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!",1053,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1054,tom riddle,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger.",1054,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1055,harry,But she's dying!,1055,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1057,tom riddle,"Yes. I'm afraid so. But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny. She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes. Ginny poured her soul out to me. I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her... Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins cruelly.",1057,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1058,tom riddle,"Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.",1058,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1059,harry,No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.,1059,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1060,tom riddle,It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat. Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.,1060,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1061,harry,But... Why?...,1061,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1062,tom riddle,"Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. But then, who should find it... but you. The very person I was most anxious to meet.",1062,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1063,harry,(getting angry) And why did you want to meet me?,1063,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1065,tom riddle,"Ginny told me all about you. I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.",1065,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1066,harry,"Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?",1066,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1067,tom riddle,It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.,1067,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1068,harry,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.,1068,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1069,tom riddle,"I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.",1069,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1070,harry,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.",1070,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1071,tom riddle,"Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been... you. (grinning) Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you.",1071,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1072,harry,Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?,1072,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1074,tom riddle,"She was afraid. Afraid you'd learn how to work the diary. Afraid I'd tell you just who it was that had been strangling all those roosters. Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE, then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.",1074,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1075,tom riddle,"Come now, Harry. Don't look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me. And we couldn't be having this little talk. And I have so many questions for you.",1075,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1076,harry,Like what?,1076,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1077,tom riddle,"Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?",1077,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1078,harry,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.,1078,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1079,tom riddle,"Voldemort is my past, present and future. Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to trace it through the air, writing three words ""TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE."" Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them ""I AM LORD VOLDEMORT.""",1079,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1080,harry,You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?,1080,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1081,tom riddle,Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name? (CONTINUED),1081,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1084,harry,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!,1084,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1085,tom riddle,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.,1085,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1086,harry,"He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE in its golden talons.",1086,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1087,harry,"Fawkes. Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.",1087,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1088,tom riddle,(giggling) This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Riddle tosses aside the hat. He turns to the statue of Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.,1088,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1089,tom riddle,"(Parseltongue) Speak to me, Slytherin. Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS. There is a RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING. Harry turns away. The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills out, uncoiling heavily to the floor. Harry turns to the wall. The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall. PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.",1089,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1091,tom riddle,"Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter, shall we? Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.",1091,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1092,tom riddle,"(Parseltongue) Kill him! The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward. Harry turns, RUNS away.",1092,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1093,tom riddle,"Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me.",1093,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1094,harry,"(to himself) Don't look. Don't look into its eyes. Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES. Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike. Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife, driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering eyes. As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall, the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away, its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.",1094,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1095,tom riddle,"Fool! Think you're safe! It can still hear you! As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE. Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE TUNNEL. 133A INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT 133A Harry RACES HEADLONG into the shadows, then looks back, sees the snake eclipse the light at the far end of the tunnel and SLITHER QUICKLY inside.",1095,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1099,tom riddle,"Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead. And I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return. Very much... alive. Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then -- impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what glitters within the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD. Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee, Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS BARED... STRIKES. Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor, watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes STILL. Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.",1099,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1100,tom riddle,"Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body? If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now. I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm turns a troubling gray.",1100,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1102,tom riddle,"So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets. Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white now, a small ghost, the only evidence of life the TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER. Harry studies the finger and what lies beneath it Tom Riddle's diary. Harry begins to crawl toward her.",1102,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1104,tom riddle,"Funny, isn't it? The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the hands of a silly little girl. As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers, then... slips the diary free.",1104,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1108,harry,"Ginny. You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron... There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays his head onto Harry's arm.",1108,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1109,harry,"You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough. Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almost instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself.",1109,2,"['harry', 'tom riddle']"
1111,harry,"Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. (looking up at Ginny) It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory... 134 INT.

1139,albus dumbledore,"Therefore, it seems only fitting... (eyes twinkling) That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.

1144,albus dumbledore,"First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?",1144,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"

1152,harry,Only because I asked it to.,1152,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1153,albus dumbledore,"Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices.

1159,albus dumbledore,"Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.

1161,albus dumbledore,"Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only this time, he chose to act through someone else. By means of... this. As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy, Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to Lucius.",1161,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1162,albus dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. (a chill to his voice) One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe.",1162,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
