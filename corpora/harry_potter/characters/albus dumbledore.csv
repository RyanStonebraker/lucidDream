1,albus dumbledore, I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.,1,1,['albus dumbledore']
4,albus dumbledore," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.",4,1,['albus dumbledore']
6,albus dumbledore, Hagrid is bringing him.,6,1,['albus dumbledore']
8,albus dumbledore," Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.",8,1,['albus dumbledore']
10,hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.",10,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
11,albus dumbledore," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?",11,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
12,hagrid," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.",12,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
15,albus dumbledore, The only family he has.,15,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
18,albus dumbledore, Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.,18,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
20,albus dumbledore," There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.",20,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
22,albus dumbledore, Good luck...Harry Potter.,22,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
341,albus dumbledore," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.",341,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
343,hermione," Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}",343,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
344,ron," Mental that one, I'm telling you.",344,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
373,albus dumbledore, Let the feast...begin.,373,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
375,harry, Wow.,375,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
382,harry," Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?",382,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
588,albus dumbledore," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.",588,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
594,harry, How could a troll get in?,594,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
595,ron," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?",595,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
596,harry, Hermione! She doesn't know!,596,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
598,harry, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!,598,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
794,albus dumbledore," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.",794,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
795,harry," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?",795,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
796,albus dumbledore," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}",796,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
799,hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,799,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
800,ron, This is light?,800,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
801,hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",801,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
803,hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""",803,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
804,ron, Immortal?,804,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
805,hermione, It means you'll never die.,805,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
806,ron, I know what it means!,806,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
1085,albus dumbledore," Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?",1085,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1086,harry, Admirers?,1086,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1087,albus dumbledore," What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.",1087,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1088,harry, Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?,1088,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1089,albus dumbledore, Fine. They're both just fine.,1089,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1090,harry," But, what happened to the Stone?",1090,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1091,albus dumbledore," Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.",1091,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1092,harry," But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?",1092,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1093,albus dumbledore," {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.",1093,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1094,harry," How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...",1094,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1095,albus dumbledore," Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}",1095,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1096,harry," Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?",1096,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1097,albus dumbledore," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.",1097,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1098,harry, What is it?,1098,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1099,albus dumbledore," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.",1099,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1101,harry," All right there, Ron?",1101,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1102,ron, All right? You?,1102,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1103,harry, {shrug} All right. Hermione?,1103,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1104,hermione, {smile} Never better.,1104,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1108,albus dumbledore," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.",1108,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1112,albus dumbledore," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}",1112,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1113,harry, {Pats} Good job.,1113,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1114,albus dumbledore," Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}",1114,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1115,hermione, We're tied with Slytherin!,1115,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1116,albus dumbledore," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.",1116,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1118,albus dumbledore," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!",1118,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1120,hagrid, Yes! {grins},1120,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1126,hagrid," Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.",1126,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
1128,hermione," Come on, Harry.",1128,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
281,albus dumbledore,They are not. Harry and Ron turn. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE stands in the doorway. Alongside him is a distinctly annoyed PROFESSOR McGONAGALL.,281,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
282,harry,Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall...,282,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
283,snape,"Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...",283,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
284,albus dumbledore,"I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.",284,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
285,ron,"(rising gloomily) We'll go and get our stuff. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?",285,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
287,ron,"Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be sending owls to both of your families tonight. And you will each get a detention. Snape casts a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron.",287,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
288,albus dumbledore,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor. Taking it, he reads the back ""KWIKSPELL. A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN BEGINNER'S MAGIC."" It's addressed to ""MR. ARGUS FILCH.""",288,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
289,harry,"Mr. Filch. You dropped this... Filch turns, eyes the envelope with embarrassment, then snatches it from Harry's hand and stuffs it into his pocket.",289,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
294,hermione,I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.,294,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
295,ron,"I should think you'd mind your own business. They glare at each other. PROFESSOR SPROUT, a squat little witch, TAPS her wand on a stack of POTS.",295,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
297,hermione,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.",297,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
417,albus dumbledore,"Argus! Dumbledore marches forward, trailed by a phalanx of teachers. Seeing the wall, Dumbledore's face darkens.",417,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
418,albus dumbledore,"Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. (to Harry, Ron, Hermione) Everyone except you three. As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall and, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.",418,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
420,albus dumbledore,"She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified.",420,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
422,albus dumbledore,But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.,422,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
424,harry,"It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.",424,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
427,snape,"If I might, Headmaster... The others turn, watch Snape separate from the shadows.",427,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry']"
428,snape,Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time... Could Snape be defending Harry and the others blink. them?,428,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry']"
429,snape,"However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.",429,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry']"
431,hermione,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when Harry said...",431,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
432,snape,"(raising an eyebrow) Yes, Miss Granger?",432,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
434,albus dumbledore,Innocent until proven guilty.,434,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
437,albus dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When they have matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. In the meantime, I advise caution. To all.",437,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
439,ron,"A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course. It's also why he hates students so much. He's bitter. Hermione, who's only been half-listening -- as if trying to unravel something in her mind -- speaks then.",439,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
440,hermione,Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?,440,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
441,harry,Yes.,441,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
442,hermione,And did he hear it?,442,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'snape', 'harry']"
443,harry,He said he didn't.,443,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
444,ron,Maybe he was lying.,444,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
445,hermione,"I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald. Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.",445,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
447,harry,"You do believe me, don't you?",447,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
535,albus dumbledore,"There's been another attack. Madam Pomfrey GASPS. It is not a statue lying there. It is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker... Dumbledore opens the camera. A JET OF STEAM HISSES forth. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What does this mean, Albus?",535,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
536,albus dumbledore,"It means our students are in great danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was fortunate. If not for this... (holding up the camera) He would surely be dead.",536,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
539,albus dumbledore,Tell them the truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell them it's as we feared. The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.,539,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
541,hermione,"Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?",541,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
542,ron,"Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it.",542,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
543,hermione,Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.,543,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
544,ron,"Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?",544,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
545,hermione,Never. No one over comes in here.,545,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
546,ron,Why?,546,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
547,hermione,Moaning Myrtle.,547,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
548,ron,"Who's Moaning Myrtle? There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A YOUNG GIRL COMES RACING OUT OF THE WALL. FACE TO FACE with Ron.",548,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
626,albus dumbledore,"About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day. He's really very handsome most of the time. (off Harry's look) Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Harry looks to the floor. The ASHES swirl. A baby Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the dust.",626,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
627,albus dumbledore,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster -- BURSTS through the door.",627,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
628,hagrid,"It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore!",628,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
630,albus dumbledore,Hagrid --,630,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
631,hagrid,I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found. It can't've bin 'im!,631,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
632,albus dumbledore,Hagrid --,632,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
633,hagrid,I'll swear ter it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic --,633,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
634,albus dumbledore,HAGRID! I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.,634,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
635,hagrid,"Oh. Right. I'll wait outside then. As Hagrid exits, Harry looks hopefully at Dumbledore.",635,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
636,harry,"You don't think it was me, Professor?",636,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
637,albus dumbledore,"No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me. Anything at all? Dumbledore waits. Harry debates. Finally...",637,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
638,harry,"No, Professor. Nothing. 78 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY 78 Students drift into the snow with their trunks, heading home for holiday. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear, Ernie and few others cast wary glances.",638,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
641,ron,"Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh.",641,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
642,harry,He's the only one.,642,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
643,ron,"Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?",643,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
644,harry,Maybe they're right.,644,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
645,hermione,(reproachfully) Harry!,645,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
646,harry,(frustrated) I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue. What else don't I know about myself? Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.,646,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
647,hermione,"You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.",647,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
787,albus dumbledore,"It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.",787,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle', 'hermione']"
789,tom riddle,"Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if... Riddle glances toward the young wizards, watches them carry the stretcher out of the Hall, into the night.",789,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle', 'hermione']"
790,tom riddle,... the rumors were true.,790,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle', 'hermione']"
791,albus dumbledore,"I'm afraid they are, Tom.",791,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
792,tom riddle,"About the school as well? They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?",792,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
793,albus dumbledore,"Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid.",793,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
794,tom riddle,Sir? If it all stopped. If the person responsible was caught...,794,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
795,albus dumbledore,"Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?",795,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'tom riddle']"
796,tom riddle,"(a long beat) No, sir. Nothing. Dumbledore studies Riddle for a moment.",796,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle']"
797,albus dumbledore,"Very well then. Hurry along. Dumbledore strides directly past Harry, not seeing him. When he is gone, Riddle moves quickly, toward the dungeon steps.",797,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle']"
802,tom riddle,"Evening, Hagrid. Hagrid SLAMS the door shut.",802,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle']"
803,tom riddle,"I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone --",803,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle']"
804,hagrid,"No, yeh can't! Yeh don' understand!",804,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle', 'hagrid']"
805,tom riddle,Hagrid. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.,805,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle', 'hagrid']"
806,hagrid,It wasn' him! Aragog never'd kill no one! Never!,806,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle', 'hagrid']"
807,tom riddle,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now... stand aside... Riddle draws his wand, BLASTS the closed DOOR off its hinges, extinguishing the torches within. Harry GASPS. A low-slung CREATURE with a tangle of black legs, a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers, scuttles out of the shadows. As Riddle points his wand at it, Hagrid LEAPS...",807,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'tom riddle', 'hagrid']"
869,albus dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid.",869,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
871,ron,(whispering to Harry) That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge. The Minister of Magic! Harry elbows Ron to shut him up.,871,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
873,hagrid,"I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...",873,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

876,hagrid,Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.,876,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
879,hagrid,What're you doin' here! Get outta my house!,879,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hagrid']"
882,albus dumbledore,"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?",882,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
886,hagrid,An' how many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed!,886,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
888,hagrid,Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin's next!,888,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
890,albus dumbledore,"Calm yourself, Hagrid! (steely-eyed) If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it. Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.",890,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
892,hagrid,"If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow the spiders. That'd lead 'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'. Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him out. As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL, scratching at the closed door. Harry and Ron emerge from the cloak.",892,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hagrid']"
893,ron,"Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.",893,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hagrid']"
894,harry,"Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.",894,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
895,harry,C'mon. 103.,895,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
898,ron,What are you doing?,898,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
899,harry,You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.,899,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
900,ron,"They're heading into the Dark Forest. Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang, follows.",900,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
1125,albus dumbledore,"Ingenious. Simply... ingenious. (looking up) Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught him myself fifty years ago. After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped. When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been.",1125,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1130,albus dumbledore,"Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Certainly, Albus. As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs. Weasley's VOICE carries",1130,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1132,albus dumbledore,"You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?",1132,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1133,harry,"Yes, sir.",1133,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1134,ron,"Yes, sir.",1133,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1135,albus dumbledore,And that there is sufficient evidence to expel you both?,1135,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1136,harry,"Yes, sir.",1136,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1137,ron,"Yes, sir.",1136,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1139,albus dumbledore,"Therefore, it seems only fitting... (eyes twinkling) That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor the House Cup.",1139,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1141,harry,"(grinning) Thank you, sir.",1141,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1142,ron,"(grinning) Thank you, sir.",1141,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1143,albus dumbledore,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. We need our gamekeeper back. Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.",1143,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1144,albus dumbledore,"First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?",1144,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1145,harry,"It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.",1145,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1147,albus dumbledore,"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",1147,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1148,harry,Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?,1148,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1149,albus dumbledore,"Not intentionally, but... yes.",1149,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1150,harry,So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.,1150,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1151,albus dumbledore,"It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.",1151,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
1152,harry,Only because I asked it to.,1152,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1153,albus dumbledore,"Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices. (smiling at him) If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this. Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. An ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.",1153,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1154,harry,'Godric Gryffindor.',1154,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1155,albus dumbledore,Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat. . (4) 135,1155,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1157,harry,"Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys! Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.",1157,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1159,albus dumbledore,"Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. (a wry smile) Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.",1159,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1161,albus dumbledore,"Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only this time, he chose to act through someone else. By means of... this. As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy, Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to Lucius.",1161,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1162,albus dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. (a chill to his voice) One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe.",1162,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1166,harry,"Sir? I wonder if I could have that. Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary. 135A EXT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 135A As the elevator opens, Harry dashes out.",1166,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1167,harry,"Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's hand.",1167,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1169,harry,"I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS",1169,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry']"
1188,albus dumbledore,"Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified. Everyone applauds.",1188,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1189,albus dumbledore,"Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.",1189,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1190,hermione,"Oh, no! At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's Hagrid. He enters. Stops. Looks around. The room falls SILENT. All eyes upon him. He glances around. Nervous. Embarrassed.",1190,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1191,hagrid,Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n confused. Some ruddy bird named Errol.,1191,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"

1195,harry,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly... brings his hands together. The others join him. Soon, everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING. As the students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes, and... CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the celebration. WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the night. FADE TO BLACK.",1195,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'hermione', 'ron', 'harry', 'hagrid']"
101,albus dumbledore,"welcome! welcome to another year at hogwarts! i have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. i myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair... mcgonagall clears her throat.",101,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
102,albus dumbledore,"as some of you may know, professor kettleburn, our care of magical creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. fortunately, i'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own rubeus hagrid!",102,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
104,albus dumbledore,"the dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. while they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities. under no circumstances are you to approach them. it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.",104,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
107,ron,"good to be home, eh, harry? harry turns -- caught -- and finds ron studying him from his own bed, scabbers cradled in his hand. harry nods and turns to the window..",107,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry']"
112,ron,where'd you come from?,112,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron']"
188,albus dumbledore,mr. filch. round up the ghosts. tell them to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady.,188,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
190,albus dumbledore,dear lady. who did this to you?,190,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
191,albus dumbledore,"secure the castle, mr. filch. the rest of you... to the great hall.",191,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

195,snape,"you may recall, prior to the start of term, i did express my concerns when you appointed professor --",195,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'snape']"
196,albus dumbledore,"no... i feel quite confident the castle is safe. and i'm more than willing to let the students return to their houses. but tomorrow. for now, let them sleep... as dumbledore's gaze finds harry, he shuts his eyes, feigns sleep.",196,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'snape']"

206,snape,"now. which of you can tell me the difference between an animagus and a werewolf? as the class stares mutely at a slide of an attacking werewolf, hermione waiting desperately for someone to respond to snape's question, the moth flutters by harry.",206,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'snape']"
303,albus dumbledore,sir cadogan. is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter gryffindor tower tonight?,303,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
305,harry,he was right there. close enough to touch. i could've killed him.,305,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
306,ron,i find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.,306,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
307,ron,"harry was there! he'll tell you how it was. go on, harry, tell her.",307,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
308,ron,"really? wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons! a person could die being your friend, harry! ron stops, wishes he could take it back. they all wish he could. avoiding each other's eyes, they turn, continue on.",308,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

443,albus dumbledore,"i do, miss granger. but i'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others. a child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. as dumbledore turns to the window, a shooting star plummets silently through the sky.",443,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
444,albus dumbledore,"by the way, when in doubt, i find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... good luck. he smiles, exits. harry glances curiously at the chocolate.",444,3,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
