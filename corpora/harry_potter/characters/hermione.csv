310,hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.,310,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
311,ron, No.,311,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
312,hermione," Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.",312,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
313,ron," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!",313,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
315,hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?",315,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
316,ron, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.,316,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
317,hermione," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}",317,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
319,hagrid," Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!",319,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
321,hagrid," Hello, Harry.",321,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
322,harry," Hey, Hagrid.",322,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
323,ron, Whoaa!,323,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
324,hagrid," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.",324,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
326,ron, Wicked.,326,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
338,hermione," It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.",338,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
341,albus dumbledore," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.",341,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
343,hermione," Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}",343,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
344,ron," Mental that one, I'm telling you.",344,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
352,ron, There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.,352,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
396,hermione, Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?,396,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
398,ron, Ahh!,398,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
399,hermione, Eugh.,399,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
407,ron," Look at that one, Harry!",407,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
408,harry, I think she fancies you.,408,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
444,hermione," I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.",444,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
446,harry," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.",446,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
453,harry, Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.},453,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
456,hermione, Up. Up. Up. Up.,456,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
457,ron," Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}",457,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
485,hermione," Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.",485,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
487,harry," Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!",487,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
510,hermione, You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.,510,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
512,ron," Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.",512,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
513,harry, I-I didn't know.,513,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
515,ron," I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.",515,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
516,harry, Who doesn't?,516,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
518,ron, Ahh!,518,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
519,hermione, {Gasps.},519,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
520,harry, What's happening?,520,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
521,hermione," The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}",521,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
522,harry, {taps Ron} Let's go this way.,522,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
523,ron," Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}",523,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
524,harry, Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?,524,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
525,hermione, We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.,525,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
527,harry, Let's go.,527,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
529,ron, It's Filch's cat!,529,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
530,harry, Run!,530,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
532,harry, It's locked!,532,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
533,ron," That's it, we're done for!",533,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
534,hermione," Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}",534,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
535,ron, Alohomora?,535,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
536,hermione," Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.",536,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
539,hermione, Filch is gone.,539,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
540,ron, Probably thinks this door's locked.,540,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
541,hermione, It was locked.,541,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
542,harry," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}",542,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
545,ron, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.,545,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
546,hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",546,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
547,ron," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}",547,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
548,hermione, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.,548,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
549,harry, Guarding something?,549,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
550,hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}",550,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
551,ron, She needs to sort out her priorities!,551,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
555,harry, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.},555,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
557,harry, I like this ball.,557,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
559,harry, What do I do with it?,559,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
568,hermione," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.",568,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
569,ron," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.",569,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
571,hermione, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.},571,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
577,harry," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.",577,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
579,ron," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!",579,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
581,harry, I think she heard you.,581,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
602,hermione, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.},602,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
603,ron," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}",603,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
604,hermione, Ahhh! Help!,604,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
606,harry," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}",606,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
607,ron, Ew.,607,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
609,harry," Whoa, whoa whoa!",609,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
611,harry, Do something! {swipe},611,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
612,ron, What? {swipe},612,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
613,harry, Anything! Hurry up!,613,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
615,hermione, Swish and flick!,615,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
616,ron," Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.",616,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
618,hermione, Is it...dead?,618,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
619,harry, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.,619,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
624,hermione," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}",624,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
626,hermione, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.,626,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
630,ron," Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.",630,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
631,hermione," Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.",631,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
632,harry, I'm not hungry.,632,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
634,snape," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}",634,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
635,harry, That explains the blood.,635,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
636,hermione, Blood?,636,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
637,harry," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.",637,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
638,hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?,638,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
639,harry," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.",639,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
640,hermione, So you're saying...,640,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'snape']"
641,harry, That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.,641,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
643,hermione," Bit early for mail, isn't it?",643,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
644,harry, But I-I never get mail.,644,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
645,ron, Let's open it.,645,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
647,harry, It's a broomstick!,647,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
648,ron," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!",648,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
649,harry, But who...?,649,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
653,harry, A little bit.,653,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
689,hermione, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!,689,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
690,ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?,690,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
691,hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.},691,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
693,ron," Come on, Hermione!",693,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
695,hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.,695,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
698,snape," What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}",698,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape']"
699,ron, Go!,699,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'snape']"
700,hagrid, Go go go!,700,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid', 'snape']"
703,hagrid, Looks like he's gonna be sick!,703,1,"['ron', 'hermione', 'hagrid', 'snape']"
710,hermione, Whoo-hoo!,710,1,"['hermione', 'hagrid']"
715,hagrid, Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?,715,1,"['hermione', 'hagrid']"
716,harry, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?,716,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
717,hagrid, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?,717,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
718,ron, Fluffy?,718,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
719,hermione, That thing has a name?,719,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
720,hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the",720,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
721,harry, Yes?,721,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
722,hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.",722,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
723,harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!",723,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
724,hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,724,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
725,hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.",725,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
726,harry, Exactly.,726,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
727,hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.",727,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
728,harry, Nicholas Flamel?,728,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
729,hagrid, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.},729,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
730,harry, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?,730,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
731,hermione, I don't know.,731,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
733,harry, Knight to E-5.,733,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
736,ron, Queen to E-5.,736,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
738,hermione, That's totally barbaric!,738,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
739,ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.,739,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
740,hermione, See you haven't.,740,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
741,ron," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!",741,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
742,hermione," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.",742,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
743,ron, We've looked a hundred times!,743,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
744,hermione, Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.},744,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
745,ron, I think we've had a bad influence on her.,745,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"

749,ron," Happy Christmas, Harry.",749,1,"['ron', 'hermione']"
750,harry," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?",750,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
751,ron," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!",751,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
752,harry, I've got presents?,752,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
753,ron, Yeah!,753,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
754,harry, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.},754,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
799,hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,799,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
800,ron, This is light?,800,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
801,hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",801,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
803,hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""",803,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
804,ron, Immortal?,804,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
805,hermione, It means you'll never die.,805,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
806,ron, I know what it means!,806,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'hermione']"
807,harry, Shh!,807,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
808,hermione," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!",808,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
811,harry, Hagrid!,811,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

815,hagrid, Oh.,815,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
817,harry, We think Snape's trying to steal it.,817,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
818,hagrid," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?",818,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

828,hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...,828,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
829,ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",829,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
830,hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",830,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
832,hermione, Is that...a dragon?,832,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

841,harry, Malfoy.,841,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
842,hagrid," Oh, dear.",842,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
862,hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.",862,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
863,hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.",863,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
867,hagrid, Right. Let's go.,867,1,"['hermione', 'hagrid']"
869,harry," Hagrid, what's that?",869,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
870,hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.",870,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
871,ron, {weakly} Okay.,871,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
872,hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}",872,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
894,hermione, Harry!,894,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
895,hagrid," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}",895,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
899,hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",899,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
900,harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}",900,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
901,ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?",901,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
902,harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.",902,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
903,ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!",903,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
904,hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,904,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
907,hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.",907,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
908,ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?",908,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
909,harry, My scar. It keeps burning.,909,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
910,hermione, It's happened before.,910,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
911,harry, Not like this.,911,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
912,ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.,912,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
913,harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}",913,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
914,hermione, What is it?,914,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
915,harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?",915,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
916,hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.,916,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
917,harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",917,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
918,hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",918,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
919,harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,919,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
920,hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",920,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
922,hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!,922,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
924,harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!",924,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
932,hermione, And with Dumbledore gone,932,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
934,snape," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?",934,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
935,hermione, Uh...we were just...,935,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
936,snape," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}",936,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
937,hermione, Now what do we do?,937,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
938,harry, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.,938,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
940,harry, Trevor.,940,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
941,ron," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!",941,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione', 'ron']"
943,harry," Now, Neville, listen. We were",943,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione', 'ron']"
945,hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.",945,1,"['snape', 'harry', 'hermione', 'ron']"
947,ron," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.",947,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
948,harry, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.,948,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
949,hermione, Sorry.,949,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
950,ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}",950,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
952,hermione, Ow! You stood on my foot!,952,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
953,ron, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.},953,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
954,hermione, Alohomora.,954,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
956,ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.",956,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
957,harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.},957,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
958,ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!,958,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
959,harry, We have to move its paw.,959,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
960,ron, What?!,960,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
961,harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?",961,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
962,hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.,962,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
964,ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}",964,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
965,harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.},965,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
966,ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.",966,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
967,harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.},967,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
968,hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.",968,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
969,ron," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!",969,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
972,ron, Now what are we gonna do?!,972,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
974,harry, Hermione! Where are you?!,974,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
977,ron, Ahh! Harry!,977,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
980,hermione, Are you okay?,980,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
981,harry," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.",981,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
982,ron, Help!,982,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
983,hermione," He's not relaxing, is he?",983,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
984,harry, Apparently not.,984,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
985,ron, Help! Help me!,985,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
986,hermione, We've got to do something!,986,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
987,harry, What?,987,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
988,hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}",988,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
989,ron, Ahhh!,989,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
990,harry," Ron, are you okay?",990,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
991,ron, Yeah.,991,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
992,harry, Okay.,992,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
993,ron, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!,993,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
994,harry, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.,994,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
996,hermione, What is that?,996,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
997,harry, I don't know. Sounds like wings.,997,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
999,hermione, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,999,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1000,harry," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}",1000,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1001,hermione, What's this all about?,1001,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1002,harry, I don't know. Strange.,1002,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1004,ron," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.",1004,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1005,hermione, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!,1005,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1006,ron, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.,1006,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1007,harry, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.},1007,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1008,hermione," What's wrong, Harry?",1008,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1009,harry, It's too simple.,1009,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1010,ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!",1010,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1012,ron, This complicates things a bit!,1012,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1014,harry, Catch the key!,1014,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1016,ron, Hurry up!,1016,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1019,hermione, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.,1019,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1020,harry, Where are we? A graveyard.,1020,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1021,ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}",1021,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1022,harry, There's the door.,1022,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1024,hermione, Now what do we do?,1024,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1025,ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}",1025,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1026,hermione, What happens now?,1026,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1027,ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}",1027,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1028,hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?",1028,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1029,ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!",1029,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1031,ron," Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.",1031,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1032,harry, Wait a minute.,1032,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1033,ron," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.",1033,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1034,harry," No, Ron! No!",1034,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1035,hermione, What is it?,1035,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1036,harry, He's going to sacrifice himself!,1036,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1037,hermione," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!",1037,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1038,ron," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.",1038,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1040,ron, Check.,1040,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1042,ron, Ahhhh!,1042,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1043,harry," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.",1043,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1044,hermione," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.",1044,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1045,harry, Not as good as you.,1045,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1046,hermione," {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.",1046,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1049,harry, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one,1049,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1051,harry," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.",1051,1,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1053,harry, Snape was trying to...save me?,1053,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
1055,harry, Th-then you let the troll in.,1055,1,"['harry', 'hermione']"
1104,hermione, {smile} Never better.,1104,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1108,albus dumbledore," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.",1108,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1112,albus dumbledore," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account.

1115,hermione, We're tied with Slytherin!,1115,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1116,albus dumbledore," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.",1116,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"
1118,albus dumbledore," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!",1118,1,"['albus dumbledore', 'harry', 'hermione']"

1132,harry," Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}",1132,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1133,hagrid," Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.",1133,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1134,harry," But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.",1134,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1135,hagrid," I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.",1135,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1137,hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?",1137,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
1138,harry, I'm not going home. Not really.,1138,1,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
166,hermione,"Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again. She stops then, cocks her head curiously at Harry, then takes out her wand and points it directly between his eyes.",166,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
167,hermione,"Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.",167,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
168,harry,I need to remember that one.,168,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

172,hermione,"Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.",172,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
173,harry,Who?,173,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

347,ron,He says he's done.,347,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

356,harry,Draco?,356,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

366,hermione,"Ron! Say something! Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES. Hermione draws back, and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth. The Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER.

371,hagrid,Better out than in. Who was he tryin' ter curse anyway?,371,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
372,harry,"Malfoy. He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means...",372,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
373,hermione,(quietly) He called me a Mudblood.,373,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
374,hagrid,"He didn'! Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then away, obviously pained by this.",374,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
375,hermione,It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone... like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.,375,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
376,hagrid,"Yeh see, Harry. There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.",376,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"
377,harry,That's horrible.,377,2,"['harry', 'hermione', 'hagrid']"

401,harry,"(eyes darting around) I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just --",401,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

411,harry,"That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris. The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket, eyes open and blank.

412,hermione,Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?,412,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
413,ron,"(backing away) I... don't... like... spiders. Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, seconds later, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING... when they stop, seeing the wall and, standing before it, Harry, Ron and Hermione.

434,albus dumbledore,Innocent until proven guilty.,434,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'snape', 'harry', 'hermione']"
437,albus dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes.

439,ron,"A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course.

443,harry,He said he didn't.,443,2,"['albus dumbledore', 'ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

449,harry,"I can't explain it -- it was... scary. (frowning) D'you think I should've told them -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.",449,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

456,hermione,"Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing. Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement. McGonagall considers Hermione's question for a long moment, then nods. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age (CONTINUED)",456,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
459,ron,"Three glasses who? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. (a beat) According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.",459,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"

464,harry,"But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...",464,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
465,hermione,"The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?",465,2,"['ron', 'harry', 'hermione']"
