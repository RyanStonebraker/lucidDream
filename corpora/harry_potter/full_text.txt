environment: A neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.
dumbledore:  I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
environment: The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.
mcgonagall:  Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
dumbledore:  I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
mcgonagall:  And the boy?
dumbledore:  Hagrid is bringing him.
mcgonagall:  Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
albus:  Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
environment: There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.
hagrid:  Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
dumbledore:  No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
hagrid:  No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
environment: Hagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.
mcgonagall:  Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are
dumbledore:  The only family he has.
environment: They stop outside a house.
mcgonagall:  This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
dumbledore:  Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
environment: Hagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.
dumbledore:  There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.
environment: Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.
dumbledore:  Good luck...Harry Potter.
environment: The camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:
environment: HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
environment: Almost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.
environment: There is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.
petunia:  Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}
environment: A large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.
dudley:  Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
environment: Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley.
environment: Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.
petunia:  Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
environment: A larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.
vernon:  Happy birthday, son.
environment: Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.
petunia:  Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
harry:  Yes, Aunt Petunia.
environment: He sets to work.
petunia:  I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
vernon:  Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!
harry:  Yes, Uncle Vernon.
environment: Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.
dudley:  How many are there?
vernon:  Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
dudley:  Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!
vernon:  Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!
dudley:  I don't care how big they are!
petunia:  Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?
environment: Outside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.
petunia:  This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
vernon:  I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.
environment: The zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.
dudley:  Make it move.
environment: Vernon raps the glass of the cage.
vernon:  Move!
environment: Dudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.
dudley:  MOVE!
harry:  He's asleep!
dudley:  He's boring.
environment: Dudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.
harry:  Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.
environment: The snake looks up and blinks.
harry:  Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
environment: The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.
dudley:  Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!
environment: Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.
dudley:  Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
environment: Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.
snake:  Thankssssssss.
harry:  Anytime.
environment: The snake starts off.
man:  SNAKE!
environment: There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.
dudley:  Mum, mummy!
petunia:  {Sees him} AHH!
dudley:  Mum, help! Help me!
petunia:  My darling boy! How did you get in there?!
harry:  {Grins and giggles}
environment: Vernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!
environment: Back at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.
petunia:  It's all right. It's all right.
environment: They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.
harry:  Ow!
vernon:  What happened?
harry:  I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
vernon:  {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!
environment: Outside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.
environment: Harry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.
vernon:  Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
dudley:  {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!
harry:  Hey, give it back! It's mine!
vernon:  {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
environment: The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.
environment: Another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.
environment: In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.
vernon:  No more mail through this letterbox.
environment: Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.
petunia:  Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
environment: She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.
vernon:  Shoo! Go on!
environment: Inside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.
environment: Living/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.
vernon:  Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?
environment: Dudley shrugs.
harry:  {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---
environment: A letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.
dudley:  AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}
environment: Petunia and Vernon: {Screaming}
vernon:  Go away, ahh!
dudley:  What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
environment: Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.
vernon:  Give me that! Give me that letter!
environment: He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.
harry:  Get off! Ahh!
vernon:  Ahh!
harry:  They're my letters! Let go of me!
vernon:  That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
dudley:  Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!
environment: A house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.
harry:  Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}
environment: Suddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.
vernon:  Who's there? Ahh!
hagrid:  Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}
vernon:  I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!
petunia:  Ooh.
environment: Hagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.
hagrid:  Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}
all:  Ahh!
hagrid:  {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
dudley:  I-I-I'm not Harry.
environment: Harry appears: I-I am.
hagrid:  Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.
harry:  Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}
hagrid:  It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?
environment: Hagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.
harry:  {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?
hagrid:  Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
harry:  Sorry, no.
hagrid:  No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
harry:  Learnt what?
hagrid:  You're a wizard, Harry.
harry:  I-I'm a what?
harry:  A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
harry:  No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.
hagrid:  Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.
dudley:  {whimpers}
environment: Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.
harry:  Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!
vernon:  Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!
harry:  You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?
petunia:  Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.
harry:  Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
hagrid:  A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
petunia:  We had to tell him something.
hagrid:  It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
vernon:  He'll not be going!
hagrid:  Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
harry:  Muggle?
hagrid:  Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.
vernon:  I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
hagrid:  {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.
environment: Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.
dudley:  Ahh!
all:  Ahh! {family chases Dudley}
harry:  {laughs}
hagrid:  Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
harry:  {Nods} Okay.
hagrid:  {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}
environment: Harry grins, looks back, and grins again.
environment: Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.
harry:  All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?
hagrid:  If you know where to go.
environment: They go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.
environment: {Music and talking}
environment: Barkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
hagrid:  No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
tom:  Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
environment: The pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.
man:  Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.
environment: A witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.
witch:  Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
environment: A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.
quirrell:  Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
hagrid:  Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
harry:  Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}
quirrell:  F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
hagrid:  Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.
harry:  Good-bye.
environment: The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.
hagrid:  See, Harry, you're famous!
harry:  But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
hagrid:  I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}
environment: Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.
environment: Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.
hagrid:  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
environment: Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.
boy:  It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.
harry:  But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.
hagrid:  Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.
environment: Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.
harry:  Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?
hagrid:  They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
environment: The goblin looks up.
goblin:  And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
hagrid:  Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}
goblin:  Very well.
environment: Racing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.
griphook:  Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}
environment: The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.
hagrid:  Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?
environment: They continue on through the cavern.
griphook:  Vault 713.
harry:  What's in there, Hagrid?
hagrid:  Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
griphook:  Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}
hagrid:  Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.
environment: Harry nods.
scene:  Outside in the street, walking.
harry:  I still need...a wand.
hagrid:  A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
environment: Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands, but no people.
harry:  {Softly} Hello? Hello?
environment: There is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.
ollivander:  I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.
harry:  Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}
ollivander:  Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.
harry:  Sorry, but what's curious?
ollivander:  I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}
harry:  And...who owned that wand?
ollivander:  Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}
environment: There is a knock on the window.
hagrid:  Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}
harry:  Wow.
scene:  Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.
hagrid:  You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.
harry:  He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.
hagrid:  {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
harry:  Maybe if you wrote it down?
hagrid:  No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.
harry:  Voldemort?
hagrid:  Shh!!
environment: {Harry looks around}
environment: A flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.
hagrid:  It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}
harry:  Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
hagrid:  Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
harry:  What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?
hagrid:  Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.
scene:  London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.
environment: A couple look at Hagrid.
hagrid:  What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.
environment: Harry looks at his golden ticket.
harry:  Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}
scene:  Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.
man:  Sorry.
environment: Harry sees a train master.
harry:  Excuse me, excuse me.
trainmaster:  {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.
harry:  Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?
trainmaster:  9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}
environment: A woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.
environment: Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.
harry:  Muggles?
environment: Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.
environment: A tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.
environment: Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.
george:  He's not Fred, I am!
fred:  Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!
environment: Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.
fred:  I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}
environment: Harry shakes his head in disbelief.
harry:  Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to
environment: Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.
environment: Ginny (daughter): Good luck.
environment: Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.
scene:  The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.
ron:  Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.
harry:  No, not at all.
ron:  {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.
harry:  I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
environment: {Ron goes agape.}
ron:  So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...
harry:  The what?
ron:  {whispers} Scar...?
harry:  Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}
ron:  Wicked.
environment: A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.
woman:  Anything off the trolley, dears?
ron:  {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}
harry:  {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!
ron:  Whoa!
scene:  Eating bundles of sweets.
environment: Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.
harry:  Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
ron:  They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
environment: Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.
harry:  {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?
ron:  It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.
frog:  Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}
ron:  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
harry:  Hey, I got Dumbledore!
ron:  I got about 6 of him.
harry:  Hey, he's gone!
ron:  Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?
harry:  Just a little bit.
ron:  Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
harry:  Yeah!
ron:  {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-
environment: A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.
hermione:  Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
ron:  No.
hermione:  Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
ron:  Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!
environment: {Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}
hermione:  Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?
ron:  {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.
hermione:  Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}
scene:  Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.
hagrid:  Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!
environment: Harry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.
hagrid:  Hello, Harry.
harry:  Hey, Hagrid.
ron:  Whoaa!
hagrid:  Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.
environment: A number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.
ron:  Wicked.
scene:  On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.
mcgonagall:  Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup
environment: NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.
neville:  Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}
mcgonagall:  The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}
environment: DRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.
draco:  It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}
harry:  I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.
environment: Draco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.
mcgonagall:  We're ready for you now.
environment: She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.
hermione:  It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
mcgonagall:  All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.
environment: Dumbledore rises from the main table.
dumbledore:  I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.
mcgonagall:  When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.
hermione:  Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}
ron:  Mental that one, I'm telling you.
environment: Harry nods in agreement.
environment: Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!
environment: (Cheering)
environment: Hermione jumps off with a smile.
mcgonagall:  Draco Malfoy.
environment: Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.
environment: Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!
ron:  There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.
mcgonagall:  Susan Bones.
environment: A small, redhead goes up.
environment: Harry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.
harry:  Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}
ron:  Harry, what is it?
harry:  Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.
environment: Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!
mcgonagall:  Ronald Weasley.
environment: Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.
environment: Sorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!
ron:  {Sighs}
environment: (Cheering)
mcgonagall:  Harry Potter.
environment: Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.
environment: Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?
harry:  {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
environment: Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!
environment: There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.
environment: Fred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.
mcgonagall:  {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.
dumbledore:  Let the feast...begin.
environment: Food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.
harry:  Wow.
environment: Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.
environment: Ron stuffs his face.
environment: SEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.
seamus:  I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
environment: Neville laughs.
environment: Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.
harry:  Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
percy:  Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
harry:  What's he teach?
percy:  Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.
environment: Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.
ron:  Ahh!
nick:  Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
environment: Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.
environment: Hufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
girl:  Look, its the Bloody Baron!
percy:  Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?
nick:  Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}
ron:  Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
nick:  I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
hermione:  Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
nick:  Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}
ron:  Ahh!
hermione:  Eugh.
environment: Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.
percy:  Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.
boy:  Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
percy:  This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.
environment: The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.
percy:  Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}
neville:  Seamus, that picture's moving!
ron:  Look at that one, Harry!
harry:  I think she fancies you.
girl:  Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?
environment: Man in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.
girl:  Who's that?
environment: Approaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.
woman:  Password?
percy:  Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.
girl:  Oh, wow.
percy:  {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
scene:  Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.
scene:  Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.
ron:  Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?
environment: The cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.
ron:  That was bloody brilliant.
mcgonagall:  Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.
harry:  We got lost.
mcgonagall:  Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
scene:  Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.
snape:  There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.
environment: Hermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.
snape:  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}
harry:  I don't know, Sir.
snape:  And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?
harry:  I don't know, Sir.
snape:  Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?
scene:  In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.
environment: Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.
seamus:  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
harry:  What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
ron:  Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...
environment: ZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.
ron:  Ah. Mail's here!
environment: The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.
harry:  Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.
environment: Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.
seamus:  Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!
hermione:  I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.
neville:  The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
harry:  Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
scene:  Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.
hooch:  Good afternoon, class.
class:  Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
hooch:  Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!
class:  Up!
environment: Harry's broom flies into his hand.
harry:  Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}
draco:  Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}
hooch:  With feeling!
hermione:  Up. Up. Up. Up.
ron:  Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}
hooch:  Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}
environment: Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.
neville:  Oh...
hooch:  Mr. Longbottom.
girl:  Neville, what are you doing?
students:  Neville...Neville...
boy:  We're not supposed to take off, yet.
hooch:  {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!
neville:  AHH!
hooch:  Mr. Longbottom!
neville:  {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!
harry:  Neville! {shouting}
neville:  Help!!!
hooch:  Come back down this instant!
neville:  AHH!
environment: He soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.
neville:  Help!
hooch:  Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}
neville:  Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!
hooch:  Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.
girl:  Is he alright?
neville:  Owowowow.
hooch:  Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}
draco:  {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}
harry:  Give it here, Malfoy.
draco:  No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?
environment: Harry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.
hermione:  Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.
environment: Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.
harry:  Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!
draco:  Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}
environment: Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.
boy:  Good job, Harry!
environment: Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.
mcgonagall:  {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}
scene:  Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.
quirrell:  An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient
mcgonagall:  Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?
quirrell:  Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}
mcgonagall:  Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!
scene:  Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.
nick:  Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.
ron:  Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
harry:  A century, according to McGonagall.
environment: Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.
fred:  Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!
ron:  Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.
george:  Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
fred:  Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.
george:  But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
ron:  Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}
harry:  But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
hermione:  You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
scene:  The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.
ron:  Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
harry:  I-I didn't know.
scene:  The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looks, but continues walking.
ron:  I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
harry:  Who doesn't?
environment: The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.
ron:  Ahh!
hermione:  {Gasps.}
harry:  What's happening?
hermione:  The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}
harry:  {taps Ron} Let's go this way.
ron:  Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}
harry:  Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
hermione:  We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
environment: Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.
harry:  Let's go.
environment: {meow}
ron:  It's Filch's cat!
harry:  Run!
environment: The group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.
harry:  It's locked!
ron:  That's it, we're done for!
hermione:  Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}
ron:  Alohomora?
hermione:  Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
environment: Filch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.
filch:  Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}
hermione:  Filch is gone.
ron:  Probably thinks this door's locked.
hermione:  It was locked.
harry:  And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}
all:  AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}
environment: Back in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.
ron:  What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
hermione:  You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
ron:  I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}
hermione:  It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
harry:  Guarding something?
hermione:  That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}
ron:  She needs to sort out her priorities!
environment: Harry nods.
scene:  Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.
oliver:  Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?
harry:  {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}
oliver:  ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}
harry:  I like this ball.
oliver:  Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
harry:  What do I do with it?
oliver:  You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.
environment: {The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}
harry:  Whoa.
scene:  PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.
flitwick:  One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
draco:  Wingardium Levio-saaa.
environment: {All practice.}
ron:  Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}
hermione:  Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.
ron:  You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
environment: Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.
hermione:  {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}
flitwick:  Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!
environment: Seamus begins swishing at his feather.
seamus:  Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}
environment: BOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.
flitwick:  Whooaaa! Ooh.
harry:  I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
scene:  Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.
ron:  It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
environment: Hermione bustles past, sniffling.
harry:  I think she heard you.
scene:  Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.
harry:  Where's Hermione?
neville:  Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
environment: {Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}
quirrell:  TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}
environment: The room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.
dumbledore:  SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
girl:  Hufflepuff, this way!
boy:  Stay together!
environment: Snape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.
scene:  Percy is leading the house down a hall.
percy:  Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!
harry:  How could a troll get in?
ron:  Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?
harry:  Hermione! She doesn't know!
environment: The two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.
harry:  He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
scene:  In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.
harry:  Hermione, move!
environment: The troll smashes the remaining stalls.
hermione:  Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}
ron:  Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}
hermione:  Ahhh! Help!
environment: Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.
harry:  Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}
ron:  Ew.
environment: The troll snorts, and whips around.
harry:  Whoa, whoa whoa!
environment: The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.
harry:  Do something! {swipe}
ron:  What? {swipe}
harry:  Anything! Hurry up!
environment: Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.
hermione:  Swish and flick!
ron:  Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.
environment: Hermione approaches carefully.
hermione:  Is it...dead?
harry:  I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.
environment: Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.
environment: They all gasp.
mcgonagall:  Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
environment: Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...
hermione:  It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}
mcgonagall:  Ms. Granger?
hermione:  I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
mcgonagall:  Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}
quirrell:  Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....
scene:  The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.
ron:  Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.
hermione:  Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.
harry:  I'm not hungry.
environment: Snape appears.
snape:  Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}
harry:  That explains the blood.
hermione:  Blood?
harry:  Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
hermione:  But why would anyone go near that dog?
harry:  The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
hermione:  So you're saying...
harry:  That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
environment: {An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}
hermione:  Bit early for mail, isn't it?
harry:  But I-I never get mail.
ron:  Let's open it.
environment: {They open it.}
harry:  It's a broomstick!
ron:  Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!
harry:  But who...?
environment: {He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}
scene:  Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.
oiiver:  Scared, Harry?
harry:  A little bit.
oliver:  That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
harry:  What happened?
oliver:  Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.
environment: Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.
lee:  Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
environment: {Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}
environment: The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.
lee:  The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
hooch:  Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}
lee:  The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
environment: The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.
lee:  The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
environment: Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.
lee:  Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}
environment: Harry, in the air, claps.
harry:  Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!
environment: In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.
hagrid:  Well done!
lee:  Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
environment: Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!
environment: Ron and Seamus: Yay!
harry:  Yes!
lee:  Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}
gryffindors:  Yay!
environment: The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.
flint:  Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}
crowd:  {Booing}
environment: Harry is visibly upset.
environment: Slytherin laughs.
environment: The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.
flint:  {to other members} Take that side!
environment: They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.
harry:  Whoa! Whooa!
hagrid:  What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
environment: Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.
hermione:  It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
ron:  Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
hermione:  Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}
environment: Harry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.
ron:  Come on, Hermione!
environment: Hermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.
hermione:  Lacarnum Inflamarae.
environment: A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.
man:  Fire! You're on fire!
snape:  What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}
ron:  Go!
hagrid:  Go go go!
environment: Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.
environment: The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.
hagrid:  Looks like he's gonna be sick!
environment: Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.
lee:  He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
hooch:  {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!
all:  YAY!
draco:  No!
hagrid:  Yes!
hermione:  Whoo-hoo!
mcgonagall:  {Giggles happily}
environment: Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.
crowd:  Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!
environment: Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.
hagrid:  Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
harry:  Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
hagrid:  Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
ron:  Fluffy?
hermione:  That thing has a name?
hagrid:  Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
harry:  Yes?
hagrid:  Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
harry:  But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!
hagrid:  Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
hermione:  Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.
harry:  Exactly.
hagrid:  {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
harry:  Nicholas Flamel?
hagrid:  I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}
harry:  Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
hermione:  I don't know.
scene:  Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.
harry:  Knight to E-5.
environment: A piece moves across the board.
environment: Ron thinks for a moment.
ron:  Queen to E-5.
environment: A queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.
hermione:  That's totally barbaric!
ron:  That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.
hermione:  See you haven't.
ron:  Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!
hermione:  Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
ron:  We've looked a hundred times!
hermione:  Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}
ron:  I think we've had a bad influence on her.
x: mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.
ron:  {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!
environment: Harry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.
ron:  Happy Christmas, Harry.
harry:  Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?
ron:  Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!
harry:  I've got presents?
ron:  Yeah!
harry:  Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}
ron:  There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}
harry:  "Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."
environment: Harry opens the present. It is a cloak.
ron:  What is it?
harry:  Some kind of...cloak.
ron:  Well, let's see then. Put it on.
environment: Harry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.
ron:  Whoa!
harry:  My body's gone!
ron:  I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!
harry:  I'm invisible??
ron:  {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.
harry:  {comes over} There was no name. It just said, "Use it well."
environment: Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.
harry:  {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
environment: Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.
man:  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
environment: Harry slams the book shuts and puts it back.
environment: Filchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!
environment: Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.
quirrell:  Severus...I-I thought...
snape:  You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
quirrell:  W-what do you m-mean?
snape:  You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
environment: Filch appears, carrying the broken lamp.
filch:  Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.
environment: They all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.
harry:  Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.
environment: The boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.
harry:  Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
ron:  Why?
harry:  There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!
environment: Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.
harry:  Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
ron:  I only see me.
harry:  {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad
ron:  That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
harry:  How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}
environment: Another night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.
dumbledore:  Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
harry:  So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?
dumbledore:  Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}
environment: Daytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.
environment: In the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.
hermione:  I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
ron:  This is light?
hermione:  {glares} Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
environment: Ron and Harry: The what?
hermione:  Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
ron:  Immortal?
hermione:  It means you'll never die.
ron:  I know what it means!
harry:  Shh!
hermione:  "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!
environment: They all look at each other.
environment: Nighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.
harry:  Hagrid!
hagrid:  {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}
environment: All 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
environment: {Door reopens.}
hagrid:  Oh.
environment: {They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}
harry:  We think Snape's trying to steal it.
hagrid:  Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
harry:  Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.
hagrid:  Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
harry:  What?
hagrid:  You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
harry:  Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?
hermione:  {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
hagrid:  That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
environment: {Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}
harry:  Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
hagrid:  That? It's a ... its um...
ron:  I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?
hagrid:  I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.
environment: The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.
hermione:  Is that...a dragon?
ron:  That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
hagrid:  Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}
harry:  Norbert?
hagrid:  Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?
ron:  {laughs}
hagrid:  Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.
environment: Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.
hagrid:  Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}
harry:  Malfoy.
hagrid:  Oh, dear.
environment: The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.
harry:  Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
ron:  It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
harry:  I don't understand. Is that bad?
ron:  It's bad.
environment: They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.
mcgonagall:  Good evening.
environment: Malfoy appears smugly beside her.
environment: McGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.
mcgonagall:  Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
harry:  50?!
mcgonagall:  Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
environment: Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.
draco:  Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."
mcgonagall:  No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.
environment: Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.
environment: Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.
filch:  A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
hagrid:  {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
hermione:  Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
hagrid:  Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.
filch:  Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
draco:  The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!
filch:  There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}
hagrid:  Right. Let's go.
scene:  In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.
harry:  Hagrid, what's that?
hagrid:  What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
ron:  {weakly} Okay.
hagrid:  And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}
draco:  Okay. Then I get Fang!
hagrid:  Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}
environment: Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.
draco:  You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
harry:  If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
draco:  Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.
environment: The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.
harry:  What is it, Fang?
environment: Up ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.
environment: Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.
draco:  {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!
environment: Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.
firenze:  Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
harry:  {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?
firenze:  A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
harry:  But who would choose such a life?
firenze:  Can you think of no one?
harry:  Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
firenze:  Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
harry:  The Philosopher's Stone.
environment: Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.
hermione:  Harry!
hagrid:  Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}
firenze:  Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.
environment: {Close up on the dead unicorn.}
environment: Gryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seated, but Harry stands.
hermione:  You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
harry:  But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}
ron:  But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
harry:  I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
ron:  {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!
hermione:  Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
environment: {The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}
environment: Some time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.
hermione:  I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
ron:  Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?
harry:  My scar. It keeps burning.
hermione:  It's happened before.
harry:  Not like this.
ron:  Perhaps you should see the nurse.
harry:  I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}
hermione:  What is it?
harry:  Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?
hagrid:  I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
harry:  The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.
hagrid:  Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."
harry:  And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
hagrid:  Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."
environment: The three gape.
hagrid:  I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!
environment: McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.
harry:  We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
mcgonagall:  I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
harry:  He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
mcgonagall:  {shocked} How do you know
harry:  Someone's going to try and steal it.
mcgonagall:  I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}
environment: After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.
harry:  That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
hermione:  And with Dumbledore gone
environment: {Snape suddenly appears behind them}
snape:  Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?
hermione:  Uh...we were just...
snape:  You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}
hermione:  Now what do we do?
harry:  We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
scene:  Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.
harry:  Trevor.
ron:  Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!
neville:  {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?
harry:  Now, Neville, listen. We were
neville:  No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}
hermione:  Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.
environment: Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.
ron:  {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.
harry:  Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.
hermione:  Sorry.
ron:  It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}
scene:  The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.
hermione:  Ow! You stood on my foot!
ron:  Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}
hermione:  Alohomora.
environment: The door opens and they go in.
ron:  Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.
harry:  Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}
ron:  Uh. It's got horrible breath!
harry:  We have to move its paw.
ron:  What?!
harry:  Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?
hermione:  The harp. It stopped playing.
environment: Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.
ron:  Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}
harry:  Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}
ron:  Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
harry:  Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}
hermione:  Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
ron:  Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!
environment: Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.
environment: Ron and Harry: Hermione!!
ron:  Now what are we gonna do?!
environment: Hermione's voice: Just relax!
harry:  Hermione! Where are you?!
environment: Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.
environment: Harry relaxes and is sucked through.
ron:  Ahh! Harry!
environment: Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.
ron:  Harry!
hermione:  Are you okay?
harry:  Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
ron:  Help!
hermione:  He's not relaxing, is he?
harry:  Apparently not.
ron:  Help! Help me!
hermione:  We've got to do something!
harry:  What?
hermione:  Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}
ron:  Ahhh!
harry:  Ron, are you okay?
ron:  Yeah.
harry:  Okay.
ron:  {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
harry:  Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
environment: There is a sound.
hermione:  What is that?
harry:  I don't know. Sounds like wings.
environment: They enter into a room filled with golden "birds."
hermione:  Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
harry:  They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}
hermione:  What's this all about?
harry:  I don't know. Strange.
environment: {Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}
ron:  {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.
hermione:  Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
ron:  We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
harry:  There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}
hermione:  What's wrong, Harry?
harry:  It's too simple.
ron:  Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!
environment: Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.
ron:  This complicates things a bit!
environment: Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.
harry:  Catch the key!
environment: He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.
ron:  Hurry up!
environment: The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.
environment: They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.
hermione:  I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
harry:  Where are we? A graveyard.
ron:  This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}
harry:  There's the door.
environment: They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.
hermione:  Now what do we do?
ron:  It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}
hermione:  What happens now?
ron:  {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}
hermione:  Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
ron:  You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
environment: The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!
ron:  Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.
harry:  Wait a minute.
ron:  You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.
harry:  No, Ron! No!
hermione:  What is it?
harry:  He's going to sacrifice himself!
hermione:  No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!
ron:  {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.
environment: Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.
ron:  Check.
environment: The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.
ron:  Ahhhh!
harry:  RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.
hermione:  You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.
harry:  Not as good as you.
hermione:  {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.
environment: Harry nods and stands, walking away.
environment: Harry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.
harry:  You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
quirrell:  Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, "p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
harry:  B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.
quirrell:  No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.
harry:  Snape was trying to...save me?
quirrell:  I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
harry:  Th-then you let the troll in.
quirrell:  Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
environment: {A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.
quirrell:  Come here, Potter, now!
environment: Harry walks forward shakily.
quirrell:  Tell me. What do you see?
environment: Harry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.
quirrell:  What is it?! What do you see?!
harry:  I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.
environment: Voldemort's voice: He lies.
quirrell:  Tell the truth! What do you see?!
environment: Voldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.
quirrell:  Master, you are not strong enough.
environment: Voldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.
harry:  Voldemort.
voldemort:  Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!
environment: Harry turns and runs.
voldemort:  Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
harry:  {shakes his head} Never!
voldemort:  Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}
harry:  You liar!
voldemort:  Kill him!
environment: Quirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.
quirrell:  Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}
voldemort:  Fool! Get the stone!
quirrell:  {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!
environment: Quirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!
voldemort:  Arrrhhhhhh!
harry:  Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}
environment: The hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.
dumbledore:  Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
harry:  Admirers?
dumbledore:  What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
harry:  Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
dumbledore:  Fine. They're both just fine.
harry:  But, what happened to the Stone?
dumbledore:  Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
harry:  But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
dumbledore:  {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
harry:  How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
dumbledore:  Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}
harry:  Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
dumbledore:  Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.
harry:  What is it?
dumbledore:  Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.
environment: Harry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.
harry:  All right there, Ron?
ron:  All right? You?
harry:  {shrug} All right. Hermione?
hermione:  {smile} Never better.
environment: In the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.
environment: Dumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.
environment: She dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.
dumbledore:  Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.
environment: There is immense cheering.
students:  Whoo! Yeah!
draco:  Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}
dumbledore:  Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}
harry:  {Pats} Good job.
dumbledore:  Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}
hermione:  We're tied with Slytherin!
dumbledore:  And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.
environment: Immense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.
dumbledore:  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
environment: Cheering.
hagrid:  Yes! {grins}
environment: All students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.
seamus:  Neville! {Shakes his hand.}
environment: All rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.
lee:  Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}
environment: The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.
hagrid:  Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
environment: Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.
hermione:  Come on, Harry.
harry:  One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}
hagrid:  Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.
environment: Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.
harry:  Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}
hagrid:  Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
harry:  But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
hagrid:  I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.
environment: Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.
hermione:  Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
harry:  I'm not going home. Not really.
environment: The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.
environment: 3 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 3 Harry pages through a SCRAPBOOK, stops on a MOVING PHOTO of Ron and Hermione. SQUAWK! Harry jumps. HEDWIG pecks at the LOCK slung through her cage door, then glowers at Harry.
harry: I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER. UNCLE VERNON (O.S.) Har-ry Pot-ter!
harry: Now you've done it. 4 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 4 While AUNT PETUNIA puts the finishing touches to a PUDDING of WHIPPED CREAM and SUGARED VIOLETS, UNCLE VERNON struggles with DUDLEY'S BOW TIE, all the while glowering at Harry.
uncle vernon: I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
harry: She's bored. If I could just let her out for an hour or two --
uncle vernon: And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
environment: . 4 HARRY
harry: But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
dudley: Who'd want to be friends with you?
uncle vernon: I should think you'd be more grateful. We raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
dudley: I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs. AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the pudding.
aunt petunia: Not yet, popkin. That's for when the Masons arrive.
uncle vernon: Which should be any moment. Now. Let's run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be --
aunt petunia: In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
uncle vernon: Good. And Dudley?
dudley: I'll be waiting to open the door.
uncle vernon: Excellent. (turning on Harry) And you?
environment: . (2) 4 HARRY
harry: I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.
uncle vernon: Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. DOORBELL RINGS. Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out of the kitchen and into the hallway.
uncle vernon: Upstairs! Hurry!
environment: 6 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 6 Harry enters, turns, and stops dead a tiny CREATURE with bat-like ears and bulging green eyes is jumping on his bed as if it were a trampoline. This is DOBBY.
dobby: Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!
environment: 4. 6 HARRY
harry: What... Who are you?
dobby: Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.
harry: I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
dobby: Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin.
harry: Why don't you sit down?
dobby: S-s-sit down? Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS. LOUD TEARS. Harry panics.
harry: Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything --
dobby: Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal...
harry: You can't have met many decent wizards then. Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.
dobby: Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! 7 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 7 Uncle Vernon pours champagne for MR. and MRS. MASON. As Dobby's HEAD BANGING sounds from above, all eyes shift to the ceiling. Uncle Vernon chuckles nervously.
environment: 5. 7 UNCLE VERNON
uncle vernon: Don't mind that. It's just the... cat.
dudley: Cat? What cat?
uncle vernon: Our cat, tiger. 8 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 8 Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning dizzily. Harry regards him with a mixture of concern... and wariness.
harry: Are you... all right?
dobby: Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
harry: Your... family?
dobby: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.
dobby: But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. (in a fierce whisper) Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.
harry: Not go back? But... I have to.
dobby: This is a plot. A plot to make most terrible things happen. If Harry Potter goes back to school he will be in great danger.
environment: 6. 8 HARRY
harry: What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.
harry: Okay! I understand. You can't say -- Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY. 9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 9 Uncle Vernon is in the midst of telling a joke.
uncle vernon: They arrive at the ninth hole and -- DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above.
mr. mason: Sounds as if that cat of yours has dragged something in with it, Dursley.
uncle vernon: Not to worry. I'll sort it out. 10 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 10 Harry wrestles the lamp away from Dobby.
harry: Stop! Stop! FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.
uncle vernon: What the devil are you doing up here! You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR. Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe.
environment: 7. 10 HARRY
harry: See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got... friends.
dobby: Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
harry: Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me? Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.
dobby: Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...
harry: Give me those. Now. Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door. Panicking... 11 INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS/KITCHEN - DAY 11 ... Harry flies desperately after, Dobby bouncing like a ping-pong ball down the stairs and into the kitchen. As Harry races in, he finds Dobby on the counter, waving his arms. Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding RISES, then floats into the living room, HOVERING over the Mason's heads. The Masons don't see, but the Dursleys -- goggle-eyed--do.
harry: Dobby... Please... No...
dobby: Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.
harry: I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
environment: . 11 DOBBY
dobby: (a tragic expression) Then Dobby must do it, sir. For Harry Potter's own good. Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS. The pudding PLUMMETS... straight onto the Masons. They stand blinking, covered head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets. The Masons exit. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after them.
uncle vernon: I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs... 11A EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - DAY 11A The Masons RACE out of the house, the Dursleys FOLLOWING.
aunt petunia: We have ice cream... The Masons get into their car and drive off, just as a SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky. An OWL SWOOPS down, and DROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's feet. He picks up the letter, opens it. As he reads it, a mad gleam dances in Uncle Vernon's eye. He turns and races back inside the house. Aunt Petunia follows. 11B INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 11B Uncle Vernon runs back into the living room, extends the letter to Harry.
uncle vernon: Go on. Read it.
harry: 'Dear Mr. Potter. We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening. As you know, underage wizards...'
uncle vernon: '... are not permitted to perform spells outside school.' (CONTINUED)
environment: A. 11B
environment: UNCLE VERNON (CONT'D) (snatching the letter) You didn't tell us you weren't Allowed to use magic at home. Slipped your mind, didn't it? (CONTINUED)
environment: 9. (2) 11B
environment: UNCLE VERNON (CONT'D) Well, I've got news for you, boy. I'm locking you up! And if you try to magic yourself out, they'll expel you! You're never going back to that school! Never! 12 EXT./INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY 12
environment: Uncle Vernon fits IRON BARS to the inside of Harry's window. Drills a METAL FLAP to the base of the bedroom door. Fits a FAT, GREY LOCK to the door itself. Soaking with sweat, he casts Harry a nasty grin and pulls shut the DOOR. It closes with the DULL CLANK of a cell. 13 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13 Harry stares gloomily out the window. The METAL FLAP RATTLES and Dudley's pudgy hand slides a BOWL of TINNED SOUP onto the floor. He grins cruelly through the opening.
dudley: I know what day it is.
harry: Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.
dudley: Today's your birthday. And nobody cares. Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap. Harry sighs, takes the soup and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig.
harry: It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got. Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we... (CONTINUED)
environment: . 13 SAME SCENE - LATER
environment: Harry leans against the wall. Asleep. There is a gentle TAPPING SOUND. Harry opens his eyes and is stunned to see... RON WEASLEY staring through the bedroom window.
harry: Ron?
ron: Hiya, Harry. 13A EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 13A An OLD, TURQUOISE-COLORED FORD ANGLIA floats in midair. Ron leans out the back window. His brother FRED sits in the driver's seat. Fred's twin George is in the passenger seat.
harry: Fred? George? What're you doing here?
ron: Rescuing you, of course. Where's your trunk? 13B CLOSEUP - HARRY'S TRUNK 13B Stuffed with clothes, spellbooks. The trunk CLOSES, SNAPS SHUT. Harry drags the trunk to the windowsill, watches Ron tie off a fierce knot on the bars of Harry's window.
ron: Stand back. Harry steps back. Ron turns, nods to Fred. 13C INSERT - FRED'S FOOT 13C Fred STEPS ON the accelerator. 13D EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 13D The Ford Anglia FLIES UP into the air, the rope SNAPS TIGHT, and -- CRUNCH! -- the bars are TORN from the window. Bricks and bars RAIN DOWN onto the lawn below, a mangled mess. 13E INT. UNCLE VERNON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13E Uncle Vernon WAKES... 11.

environment: 17 INT./EXT. HARRY'S BEDROOM/THE CAR - MOMENTS LATER 17 Harry pushes the trunk over the sill into the Anglia's boot, then scrambles through the window himself, when... SQUAWK!
harry: Hedwig! Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto the ledge, when... BAM! The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN.
uncle vernon: Petunia! He's getting away! As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle. Harry tumbles into the darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible second. Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls harder. Ron braces himself, pulls back. Harry hangs, stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled steel bars. CLOSEUP Harry's hand begins to slip from Ron's fingers. INSIDE OF CAGE Hedwig PECKS feverishly at the LOCK. CLOSE-UP Ron. PANICKED.
ron: Hold on, Harry!
uncle vernon: Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere! CLOSE-UP Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's. INSIDE OF CAGE Hedwig PECKS HARDER and... the CAGE OPENS. Hedwig SWOOPS into the sky, WHEELS BACK and hammers her beak into Uncle Vernon's hand. He ROARS, stumbles back and... Ron and George pull Harry into the air.
ron: Put your foot down, Fred!
environment: . 17
environment: Like a rocket, the Anglia sails into the stars. Harry glances back, sees Aunt Petunia and Dudley join Uncle Vernon at the window. As Hedwig races up, soaring just beyond the car window, Ron turns to Harry.
ron: By the way, Harry. Happy Birthday.
environment: 18 EXT. THE BURROW - EARLY MORNING 18 As the Anglia drops through a pink sky, a haphazard mess of a HOUSE, built around a towering central chimney, appears below. By the road, a lopsided SIGN reads THE BURROW. FLUMPH! The car touches down in a WHIRLING CONE of dust, scatters a group of chickens, and fishtails to a halt. The boys spill quickly out of the car. FRED WHISPERS urgently.
fred: Hurry! Let's nip inside before Mum wakes up! 19 INT. FRONT ROOM - THE BURROW - MOMENTS LATER 19 The boys sneak inside, gently close the door. Harry stops. Magical objects surround him A CLOCK displays different chores for each family member. A pair of NEEDLES knit a sweater by themselves. And a stack of PLAYING CARDS that. A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLE themselves, providing a cooling breeze for Ron's aging rat, SCABBERS. Ron shrugs, averts his eyes self- consciously.
ron: It's not much.
harry: I think it's... brilliant! Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Slowly... GRINS. MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.) WHERE... HAVE... YOU... BEEN?! The boys nearly jump out of their skin. MRS. WEASLEY stands in the doorway. Furious. She smiles sweetly at Harry.
environment: . 19 MRS. WEASLEY
mrs. weasley: Harry! How wonderful to see you. (back to the boys) Beds empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen! (again, to Harry) I don't blame you, of course, dear.
ron: They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!
mrs. weasley: You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! (softening instantly) Care for a spot of tea, Harry?
ginny: Mummy. Have you seen my jumper -- A small, RED-HEADED GIRL appears. Sees Harry. And... SQUEALS. Dashes back up the stairs. Ron frowns.
ron: Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really.
george: Dad's home! The front door OPENS and ARTHUR WEASLEY enters. A tall man with red hair, his robes look dusty and travel-worn.
mr. weasley: What a night! Nine raids! Nine!
harry: (to Ron) Raids?
ron: Dad works at the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.
harry: The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?
environment: . (2) 19 RON
ron: That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating. Mr. Weasley hangs up his cloak, turns. Blinks.
mr. weasley: Well now. Who are you?
ron: Harry, sir. Harry Potter.
mr. weasley: Good Lord, are you really? Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did you get here?
mrs. weasley: (darkly) This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey house and back last night.
mr. weasley: Did you now! How'd it go?! (catching his wife's eye) I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed. So, Harry. You must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a parking meter? Harry is about to answer, when he notices an OWL (ERROL) soaring toward the kitchen window. To Harry's horror, the owl doesn't pull up. It just flies... SMACK!... into the glass.
mrs. weasley: That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George? George takes the unconscious Errol, absently lays him on a draining board, and takes the LETTERS clutched in his claws.
george: It's our Hogwarts letters! And look. They've sent Harry's as well.
environment: . (3) 19 MR. WEASLEY
mr. weasley: Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
fred: (reading his) This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spellbooks alone...

environment: 24 INT. LIVING ROOM - THE BURROW - DAY (LATER) 24 Everyone has gathered in front of the large fireplace.
mrs. weasley: You first, Harry dear. Mrs. Weasley offers Harry a FLOWERPOT. At the bottom is a layer of VERY SOFT DUST. Harry frowns in confusion.
ron: Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.
harry: Floo Powder? Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters.
mrs. weasley: Percy. Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done?
percy: Certainly, Mother. Don't worry, Harry. It's simple enough.
environment: . 24
environment: Percy takes a pinch from the pot, pitches it into the fireplace and BRIGHT GREEN FLAMES ROAR HIGH. To Harry's amazement, he calmly walks... straight into them.
percy: Diagon Alley. Percy VANISHES. Tentatively, Harry reaches into the pot.
mrs. weasley: Remember to speak clearly, dear!
ron: And mind you get out at the right grate!
harry: (nodding, unsure) D-Dia-gon Alley! 25 INT. SPIRALING TUNNEL 25 The SOUND is DEAFENING as Harry hurtles forward, squinting against the sting of WHIRLING SOOT and the mad, flickering lights of passing fireplaces. He falls face forward... 26 INT. BORGIN AND BURKES - STONE FIREPLACE - DAY 26 ... onto a stone hearth. Dizzy and dirty, Harry reclaims his shattered glasses. He's tumbled into a wizard's shop, but a decidedly creepy one. He starts to exit, when a WITHERED HAND in a GLASS CASE catches his eye The Hand of Glory. Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams Caution Do not touch. Cursed--Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. Oddly transfixed by it all, Harry drifts toward the exit, when...
environment: 17. 26
environment: DRACO MALFOY and his father, LUCIUS MALFOY, appear beyond the front window, approaching the shop. Harry glances about, spies a LARGE BLACK CABINET and slips inside. As he pulls the doors closed, a TINY CARD swings INTO VIEW Crushing Cabinet. Malfoy and his father enter. A stooped man (MR. BORGIN) emerges from the back room. IN THE CABINET, Harry watches, unaware that the walls around him are... SLOWLY CLOSING IN.
mr. borgin: Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to see you again. If I may, just in today --
lucius malfoy: I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. But selling.
mr. borgin: Selling?
lucius malfoy: You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids. There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act... Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.
lucius malfoy: I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call. Certain poisons and the like...
mr. borgin: Hmmm... yes. I see... INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING IN. His eyes shift upward. The ceiling is DROPPING. Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when... the HAND GRABS HIM. Draco shrieks, manages to slip free, then calms. He eyes the hand with malicious glee.
draco: Can I have this?
environment: 18. (2) 26 MR. BORGIN
mr. borgin: Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder. Best friend of thieves and plunderers. Your son has fine taste, sir.
lucius malfoy: Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin. Though if his marks don't pick up --
draco: It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. That Hermione Granger --
lucius malfoy: I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.
mr. borgin: It's the same all over. Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.
lucius malfoy: (deadly) Not with me. INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry's knees are up under his chin... Borgin checks off one last time, then returns the parchment to Lucius. Satisfied, Malfoy nods.
lucius malfoy: Very good. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow. Come, Draco. They exit. As Borgin slips into the back room, the Crushing Cabinet's doors FLY OPEN and Harry leaps free. Inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling SNAP SHUT! Borgin reappears, blinks curiously at Harry, then watches him RACE out the door. 27 EXT. KNOCKTURN ALLEY - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 27 Once outside, Harry fits his broken glasses to his face, eyes a STREET SIGN "KNOCKTURN ALLEY."
environment: 19. 27
environment: The vendors here clearly cater to the Dark Arts SHRUNKEN HEADS, POISONOUS CANDLES. One window teems with SPIDERS. AGED WITCH (O.S.) Not lost are you, my dear? Harry wheels, looking into the mossy teeth of a decrepit WITCH. She holds a tray of HUMAN FINGERNAILS.
harry: I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --
hagrid: HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin' down 'ere?
harry: Hagrid! Hagrid knocks the tray from the cursing Witch's hands, then seizes Harry by the scruff of the neck and steers him away. 28 EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY 28 Hagrid swats at Harry's sooty clothes.
hagrid: Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place, Harry. Don't want no one ter see yeh down there. People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good.
harry: I was lost, I -- Hang on. What were you doing down there?
hagrid: I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' the school cabbages. HERMIONE (O.S.) Harry! Harry looks up, sees HERMIONE GRANGER standing at the top of Gringotts' white steps. She runs down to meet them.
environment: 20. 28 HERMIONE
hermione: Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again. She stops then, cocks her head curiously at Harry, then takes out her wand and points it directly between his eyes.
hermione: Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.
harry: I need to remember that one.
hermione: C'mon. Everyone's been so worried. Hermione leads them to Gringotts, where Hermione's rather nervous-looking Muggle parents stand with the Weasleys.
mr. weasley: So you're dentists! Fascinating! I understand other Muggles quite fear you? Why is that?
mrs. weasley: Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Come now. We're off to Flourish and Blotts.
hermione: Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.
harry: Who?
environment: 29A EXT. FLOURISH AND BLOTTS - DAY 29A
environment: GILDEROY LOCKHART. A handsome, golden-haired wizard with stunning pearl-white teeth. He miles, winks at the camera.
environment: . 29A
environment: DOLLY BACK to reveal that the image of Lockhart is actually a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH propped in the window. A PLACARD declares HERE TODAY! SIGNING COPIES OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, MAGICAL ME... GILDEROY LOCKHART! 30 INT. FLOURISH AND BLOTTS - DAY 30 Harry and the others thread their way through a CHATTERING THRONG of MIDDLE-AGED LADIES, all craning their necks for a view of Lockhart, who sits signing books at the rear of the shop. At the sight of him, Mrs. Weasley pats her hair.
mrs. weasley: There he is!
ron: Mum fancies him. For this, Mrs. Weasley gives Ron a jab in the shoulder. A SHORT MAN WITH A CAMERA bumps past.
short man: Out of the way! This is for The Daily Prophet! Instantly, Lockhart looks up, flashes a smile, when...
gilderoy lockhart: It can't be Harry Potter? The crowd WHISPERS excitedly as Lockhart dives forward, seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the photographer.
gilderoy lockhart: (under his breath) Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page. (as the CAMERA FLASHES) Ladies and gentlemen! What an extraordinary moment this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me -- which, incidentally is celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop The Daily Prophet's Bestseller List -- he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works! Free of charge!
environment: . 30
environment: As the crowd CLAPS, Lockhart catches the eye of a FLUNKY and, before Harry knows it, a towering stack of books is shoved into his arms. Mortified, Harry mumbles quietly.
harry: Thank you. Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's cauldron.
harry: You have these. I'll buy my own --
draco: (appearing, sneers) Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
ginny: Leave him alone! He didn't want all that!
draco: Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend!
environment: 23. (2) 30 LUCIUS MALFOY
lucius malfoy: Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met. Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shake Harry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over the fringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLT SCAR. At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.
lucius malfoy: Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
harry: He was a murderer.
lucius malfoy: Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past. Surely, you don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named is gone forever.
harry: His name is Voldemort. Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.
lucius malfoy: You must be very brave, Mr. Potter, to dare speak his name. Or foolish.
hermione: Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring defiantly.
lucius malfoy: You must be Miss Granger. Draco's told me all about you... and your parents. Muggles, aren't you? Mr. and Mrs. Granger nod nervously. Lucius Malfoy can barely disguise his distaste for them. Arthur Weasley hurries over.
environment: . (3) 30 MR. WEASLEY
mr. weasley: Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside.
lucius malfoy: Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley.
mr. weasley: (stiffly) Lucius.
lucius malfoy: Busy time at the Ministry. All those raids. I hope they're paying you overtime. Malfoy reaches into Ginny's cauldron, removes a very old, battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.
lucius malfoy: Obviously not. Dear me. What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.
mr. weasley: We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Lucius.
lucius malfoy: (glancing at the Grangers) Clearly. The company you keep, Weasley. And I thought your family could sink no lower. Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid steps forward, puts a firm hand on Mr. Weasley's shoulder.
hagrid: Ignore 'im, Arthur. Mr. Weasley backs away. Lucius Malfoy tosses Ginny's BATTERED TEXTBOOK back into her cauldron.
lucius malfoy: Here, girl. Take your book. It's the best your father can give you. Lucius and Draco exit. Hagrid looks at the Weasleys.

environment: 30B EXT. KING'S CROSS - MORNING 30B Amid a neat line of cars, the Anglia sits at a decidedly odd angle, as if its driver were not the most skilled motorist.
environment: 32 INT. KING'S CROSS - DAY 32 The Weasleys and Harry -- pushing large TROLLEYS -- dash under the LARGE CLOCK which reads two minutes to eleven.
mrs. weasley: Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! All together now! Hurrying, they race to PLATFORMS NINE AND TEN. Quickly, Percy, Fred and George stride briskly toward the stone barrier that divides the platforms -- and simply DISAPPEAR.
mrs. weasley: Go on, Ginny. You know what to do. Ginny, looking a bit nervous, rushes toward the barrier, closes her eyes, and sleds... 32A INT. PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS - DAY 32A ... out onto the other side. As she gazes at the HOGWARTS EXPRESS, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley materialize at her side.
environment: . 32A
environment: MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.) Come, Ginny. We'll get you a seat. 32B INT. KING'S CROSS 32B Ron glances at the clock.
ron: We better hurry. Harry nods, leans into his trolley and -- CRASH! -- hits the barrier and bounces back into Ron. A GUARD glowers.
guard: What in blazes d'you two think you're doing?
harry: Sorry. Lost control of the trolley. (to Ron) Why can't we get through?
ron: I dunno. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. As Ron presses his ear to the barrier, the CLOCK CHIMES.
harry: The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it.
ron: Can't hear a thing. (a sudden thought) Harry. If we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
harry: Maybe we should go wait by the car.
ron: The car! 33 EXT. PARKING LOT (KING'S CROSS) - MOMENTS LATER 33 Pushing their trolleys madly before them, Harry and Ron dash to the car, load their belongings into the Anglia's boot.
environment: . 33 HARRY
harry: This is mad. We can't drive to Hogwarts.
ron: Who says we're driving?
harry: You don't mean -- Ron, no.
ron: Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back. And we've got to get to school, haven't we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency. Least that's what Fred and George always say...
harry: Something tells me we're going to regret this. 33A INT. ANGLIA - DAY 33A Ron TAPS his WAND on the dash and the Anglia burbles to life.
harry: No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this.
ron: No problem. Ron SHIFTS. With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the ground.
ron: There. See. Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it. Simple. Harry nods, not entirely convinced. He peers out the window. Down below, TWO PEDESTRIANS stare in disbelief.
harry: Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
ron: Right. Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and they... DISAPPEAR. Down below, the baffled pedestrians blink. 28. 34 EXT. FLYING CAR (SCOTLAND) - DAY (LATER) 34 CAMERA STARTS IN the clouds, passes through, finds Scotland's stunning green. The Anglia's ENGINE PUTTERS softly, when -- POP! - the car reappears. Ron jabs at the silver button.
ron: Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff. The car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.
ron: Any sign of the train?
harry: There! Up ahead! Look... Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS appear.
ron: Brilliant. Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few feet above the tracks. The boys peer ahead, looking for the train.
ron: It must be around here someplace. Behind them, through the Anglia's rear window, the Hogwarts Express APPEARS, closing fast. Harry and Ron perk up. Smile.
harry: Do you hear that? Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron register the DIRECTION of the sound. They glance at each other, turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the rear window.
harry: Aaaahhhhh! Ron SPINS THE WHEEL, puts his foot to the gas and -- at the last possible second -- whips the Anglia out of the train's path. The car WAFFLES, TOPPLES upside down briefly, before...

ron: Take my hand! Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far below. It's quite a drop. Harry's fingers begin to LOSE THEIR GRIP.
ron: Hold on!
harry: I'm trying! Your hand's all sweaty! Straining, Ron yanks him inside, levels off the car. As Harry falls heavily into his seat, he BUCKLES his safety belt.
harry: I think we found the train. 35 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FLYING CAR - NIGHT 35 As HOGWARTS CASTLE comes INTO VIEW, the Anglia ENTERS FRAME.
ron: Welcome home, Harry. Harry smiles at the sight of it, when... the Anglia GROANS.
harry: Just out of interest, Ron. Have you ever landed a car before?
ron: Well... no. but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either. With that, the car LURCHES, the nose DROPS, and...
ron: Uh oh.
environment: 30. 35
environment: ... Harry, Ron and car go pitching through the night. As Ron rakes the GEARS, they hurtle madly toward the CASTLE WALL.
ron: IT'S NOT WORKING!
harry: UP! UP! Ron SHIFTS desperately. The Anglia LURCHES up, barely clears the castle wall. Harry and Ron exchange a look of relief, when... the car GROANS again, LURCHES... downward.
harry: MIND THAT TREE! Down below a GIANT WILLOW TREE looms. Ron SHIFTS. Nothing.
harry: TURN! TURN! Harry reaches over and, together, he and Ron SPIN THE WHEEL. It's useless. The car is heading straight for the tree. Desperately, Ron WHIPS OUT his wand and WHACKS THE DASHBOARD.
ron: STOP! STOP! STOP! The wand SNAPS IN TWO and -- CRUNCH! -- car meets tree. Harry blinks. They hang dreamily, BALANCED on the HIGHEST LIMB.
ron: My wand! Look at my wand!
harry: Be thankful it's not your neck. THWUNMP! Something HEAVY HITS Harry's door, sends a SHUDDER through the car.
ron: What's happening? Slowly, they look up and, in disbelief, watch one of the tree's branches PULL BACK, CURL INTO ITSELF, and come LASHING FORWARD like a MASSIVE FIST. THWUMP!
environment: . (2) 35 HARRY/RON
harry: Aaaaahhhhh! The Anglia tilts crazily, slides backwards and FREE-FALLS through the air and... LANDS on lower grid of branches.
ron: Aaaaahhhhh! The Anglia tilts crazily, slides backwards and FREE-FALLS through the air and... LANDS on lower grid of branches.
ron: What kind of tree is this? Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like popcorn. WINDOWS SHATTER. Heavy DENTS appear on the roof above Ron and Harry's heads. Then the car FALLS again... ... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. Instantly, the tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR BACK AND FORTH.
harry: Aaaaahhhhh! The tree PITCHES the car into the air. As the Anglia SLAMS DOWN again, bobbing on its SQUEALING SHOCKS, the ENGINE BURBLES BACK TO LIFE. Harry LOOKS UP, peering through the shattered windscreen. The willow's branches, as one, rear back, ready for one last punishing blow. Harry CRIES OUT.
ron: Aaaaahhhhh! The tree PITCHES the car into the air. As the Anglia SLAMS DOWN again, bobbing on its SQUEALING SHOCKS, the ENGINE BURBLES BACK TO LIFE. Harry LOOKS UP, peering through the shattered windscreen. The willow's branches, as one, rear back, ready for one last punishing blow. Harry CRIES OUT.
harry: Reverse! Reverse! Ron SHIFTS, the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS, and the willow PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated. Safely clear, the doors fly open, the seats tip sideways, and Ron and Harry are ejected. As they hit the ground, their trunks fly from the boot, Hedwig's cage rockets out the back window, and Hedwig herself flaps into the night. Taillights blazing angrily, the BATTERED car speeds off, fishtailing into the Dark Forest.
ron: Dad's going to kill me. They hear a TREMENDOUS GROAN, turn back, and see the Whomping Willow assume its natural form, waiting for its next victim. 36 EXT. STONE STEPS/ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 36 Filthy and bruised, Harry and Ron drag themselves up the steps. Behind them we see the mountain of student trunks and caged pets already brought up from the train.
environment: . 36 HARRY
harry: A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
filch: Well, take a good look, lads... They stop. ARGUS FILCH stands at the top of the landing, his cat -- MRS. NORRIS -- twitching her tail at his feet.
filch: This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. 37 INT. SNAPE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 37
environment: The Evening Prophet ENTERS FRAME. The HEADLINE reads FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. Below the fold a PHOTO shows Harry and Lockhart at Flourish and Blotts. CAMERA PULLS BACK, PROFESSOR SEVERUS SNAPE stands at his desk, newspaper in hand as Harry and Ron stare with dread. Filch lurks in the doorway, eying them with pleasure.
environment: 33. 37 SNAPE
snape: You were seen! By no less then seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years.
ron: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
snape: Silence! I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight. As it is --
albus dumbledore: They are not. Harry and Ron turn. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE stands in the doorway. Alongside him is a distinctly annoyed PROFESSOR McGONAGALL.
harry: Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall...
snape: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
albus dumbledore: I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
ron: (rising gloomily) We'll go and get our stuff. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
environment: . (2) 37 RON
ron: Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be sending owls to both of your families tonight. And you will each get a detention. Snape casts a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron.
albus dumbledore: Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor. Taking it, he reads the back "KWIKSPELL. A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN BEGINNER'S MAGIC." It's addressed to "MR. ARGUS FILCH."
harry: Mr. Filch. You dropped this... Filch turns, eyes the envelope with embarrassment, then snatches it from Harry's hand and stuffs it into his pocket.

CAMERA CRANES OVER the castle walls, REVEALING the exterior of GREENHOUSE THREE, where students hurry inside for the beginning of class. 40 INT. GREENHOUSE THREE - MORNING 40 As Harry and Ron enter, SEAMUS, NEVILLE and some of the other Gryffindors hover nearby.
neville: Detention. On the first day?
seamus: That must be some kind of record.
environment: 35. 40 HERMIONE
hermione: I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.
ron: I should think you'd mind your own business. They glare at each other. PROFESSOR SPROUT, a squat little witch, TAPS her wand on a stack of POTS.
professor sprout: Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes. Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger.
hermione: Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
professor sprout: Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet. However, they will knock you out for several hours. That is why I have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would then... Ron frowns. He's gotten a BRIGHT PINK FLUFFY pair. When the class is ready, Professor Sprout leads them to the GARDEN AREA. She grasps one of the TUFTY PLANTS before her... and pulls. Harry gasps. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, extremely ugly BABY pops out of the earth, leaves growing right out of its head. Neville's eyes ROLL BACK. He FAINTS. Professor Sprout plunges the BAWLING CREATURE deep into a POT, removes her earmuffs, and the others follow suit. Everyone save Neville, who lies stretched on the ground.
professor sprout: Hm. Looks as though Mr. Longbottom neglected his muffs.
environment: . (2) 40 SEAMUS
seamus: No, ma'am. He's just fainted.
professor sprout: Very well. We'll just leave him then. Come now. Four to a tray, plenty of pots to go round... 41 INT. GREAT HALL - LUNCH - DAY 41 Percy enters in the company of PENELOPE CLEARWATER, just as NEARLY HEADLESS NICK glides by.
penelope clearwater: There's Nearly Headless Nick.
percy: Hello, Sir Nicolas.
nearly headless nick: Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater. At the Gryffindor table, Hermione has her nose buried in Gilderoy Lockhart's Travels with Trolls. Ron runs gobs of Spellotape over his BROKEN WAND, shakes his head grimly.
ron: Say it. I'm doomed.
harry: You're doomed. FLASH! -- a LIGHT BLINDS Harry. He blinks, finds a small boy (COLIN CREEVEY) standing before him with a CAMERA.
colin: Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
harry: Hello, Colin. Nice to meet --
colin: They're for my dad -- the pictures. He's a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like all our family's been until me. No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got my letter from Hogwarts. Everyone just thought I was mental.
environment: . 41 RON
ron: Imagine that.
colin: Say, Harry. D'you think your friend could take a photo of me and you standing together? Ya' know, to prove I've met you? Harry glances at Ron. He looks positively homicidal. Mercifully, just then, OWLS STREAM into the Hall.
dean thomas: Post is here! One after another, the birds swoop gracefully down, clutching letters from home. All except one, who plops beak-first into Ron's soup. Errol.
ron: Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.
seamus: Heads up, everyone. Weasley's gotten himself a Howler.
environment: A. (2) 41 NEVILLE
neville: Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my Gran once... and it was horrible. Ron looks pale. Clutched in Errol's beak is a DAMP RED ENVELOPE. Hands shaking, he takes it, opens it, and... MRS. WEASLEY'S VOICE THUNDERS, sending plates and spoons rattling. MRS. WEASLEY (V.O.) RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! (softening suddenly) Oh, and Ginny dear. Congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Ginny, sitting a bit apart from the others, looks up shyly, then returns to the SMALL BLACK BOOK she's scribbling in. Ron watches the envelope RIP ITSELF TO PIECES, then endures HOWLS of LAUGHTER from the other House tables. Colin Creevey snaps a few photos. Harry looks sympathetically at Ron.
harry: Look at it this way. How much worse can things get? 38. 42 INT. GILDEROY LOCKHART'S CLASSROOM - DAY 42 Gilderoy Lockhart paces before the class. Hermione and the girls hang on his every word, while Harry and Ron eye the LARGE, COVERED CAGE RATTLING mysteriously on his desk.
gilderoy lockhart: Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her! Lockhart awaits laughter. A few students smile weakly.
gilderoy lockhart: I see you've all bought a complete set of my books. Well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about. Just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in... Lockhart begins to circulate papers. Harry and Ron examine the questions. Ron WHISPERS to Harry.
ron: Look at these questions. They're all about him.
harry: 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?'
ron: 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'
harry: 'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday and what would his ideal gift be?'
gilderoy lockhart: You have thirty minutes. Start -- now! As quills begin to dart across pages, we --
environment: 39.
environment: Lockhart rifles through the completed exams.
gilderoy lockhart: Tut, tut. Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl. Hermione beams. Lockhart's expression suddenly darkens.
gilderoy lockhart: Now... be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here... With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.
gilderoy lockhart: I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them. A pale Neville draws back. Harry and Ron lean forward. Lockhart lets the tension build, then WHIPS off the cover. Inside the cage are several electric blue CREATURES. Eight inches tall, with pointed faces and wings, they rattle the bars and pull bizarre faces at the students.
seamus: Cornish pixies?
gilderoy lockhart: Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.
gilderoy lockhart: Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them now! Lockhart flings open the cage. Instantly, the pixies rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles, BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books. Two SEIZE Neville by the ears, lift him into the air, and begin to circle the ceiling.
environment: . 42 GILDEROY LOCKHART
gilderoy lockhart: Come on now, round them up, round them up. They're only pixies. (brandishing his wand) Peskipiski Pesternomi! The spell has absolutely no effect. A particularly obnoxious pixie makes a face, seizes Lockhart's wand and tosses it out the window. Lockhart joins the stampede to the door.
gilderoy lockhart: I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. SLAMMING the door, he's gone. Harry, Ron and Hermione stand blinking. Ron swats a pixie gnawing his ear.
ron: What do we do now?
hermione: (raising her wand) Immobilus! The pixies FREEZE IN MIDAIR. Neville falls, PLOPS onto Lockhart's desk, shaken but unhurt. He looks at Hermione.
neville: Why is it always me?
environment: 42B INT. SEVENTH FLOOR - CORRIDOR - LATER 42B Fresh from the pixies, Hermione, Ron, Harry and Neville walk. Hair askew. Robes shredded.
ron: Can you believe him?
hermione: I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.
harry: Hands on? Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing.
environment: . 42B HERMIONE
hermione: Rubbish. Read his books. You'll see all the amazing things he's done.

environment: 45 EXT. HOGWARTS - COURTYARD - DAY 45 The Gryffindor Quidditch team -- Harry, Fred, George, ALICIA SPINNET, KATIE BELL, and ANGELINA JOHNSON -- trail Oliver Wood through the courtyard, toward the distant Quidditch pitch. Several students are outside, studying.
wood: I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're going to train earlier, harder, and longer! (squinting) What the... I don't believe it! Crossing the courtyard from the other side are SEVEN BOYS in GREEN ROBES, also carrying broomsticks. At their lead is MARCUS FLINT, trollish Slytherin Captain. Ron, sitting at a table with Hermione, looks up.
environment: 42. 45 RON
ron: Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
wood: Clear out, Flint! I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
flint: Easy, Wood. I've got a note. As Wood snatches the PARCHMENT from Flint's hand, Ron and Hermione come up to join the others.
wood: 'I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.' (looking up) You've got a new Seeker? Who? A pasty-faced boy pushes to the front. It's... Malfoy.
harry: Draco?
draco: That's right. And that's not all that's new this year... As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS. The Gryffindors look stunned.
ron: Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.
flint: A generous gift from Draco's father.
draco: That's right, Weasley. You see, unlike some, my father can afford to buy the best.
hermione: At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
environment: 43. (2) 45 DRACO
draco: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. Everyone reacts as if Malfoy has said something horrific -- everyone save Harry, who looks puzzled. Instantly, Fred and George fly for Draco's throat. Oliver Wood holds them back.
wood: Save it for the match.
ron: You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! (whips out his wand) Eat slugs! Ron points his cracked wand at Malfoy. PFFT! -- a BOLT of GREEN LIGHT scissors out the wrong end, hitting Ron himself in the stomach. As he drops to the grass, Hermione runs to him
hermione: Ron! Say something! Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES. Hermione draws back, and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth. The Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER. Angrily, Ron rises, only to BELCH again. Fascinated, Colin Creevey runs up with his camera.
colin: Wow! Can you hold him still, Harry?!
harry: Get out of the way, Colin! (to Hermione) Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll know what to do. 46 INT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY 46 Hagrid rummages about, looking for something.
hagrid: Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down on that chair o'er there. As Ron sits, Hagrid pitches a BUCKET between his knees. Harry and Hermione glance up questioningly. Hagrid shrugs.
environment: 44. 46 HAGRID
hagrid: Better out than in. Who was he tryin' ter curse anyway?
harry: Malfoy. He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means...
hermione: (quietly) He called me a Mudblood.
hagrid: He didn'! Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then away, obviously pained by this.
hermione: It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone... like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
hagrid: Yeh see, Harry. There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.
harry: That's horrible.
ron: (BELCHES forth a slug) It's disgusting!
hagrid: An' it's codswallop ter boot. Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a wizard today that's not half-blood or less. If we 'adn't married Muggles we'd've died out long ago. Besides, they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can't do... (taking her shoulder) Don' you think on it, Hermione. Don' you think on it fer a minute. /45A.

environment: 49 INT. GILDEROY LOCKHART'S OFFICE - EVENING (HOURS LATER) 49 CAMERA PANS the walls of Lockhart's office, lined with FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS of... Gilderoy Lockhart. Harry and Lockhart work by candlelight at an ornate desk. Bleary- eyed, Harry addresses envelopes, while a cheery Lockhart puts his signature to the stack of GLOSSY PHOTOS bearing his image.
gilderoy lockhart: Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail? Harry forces a smile.
gilderoy lockhart: Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. Harry nods, glancing gloomily at the towering stack of envelopes that remain. Dipping his quill, he starts to write, when... a CHILLY VOICE fills the room.
voice: Come... come to me...
environment: 49. 49 HARRY
harry: What?
gilderoy lockhart: I was saying, six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records!
harry: No... not you, that... voice.
gilderoy lockhart: Voice?
harry: That... voice. Didn't you hear it?
gilderoy lockhart: What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit drowsy. Great Scott -- and no wonder -- look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Dinner's nearly done! If you hurry you might make pudding. Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun!
harry: Spooky. 49A INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 49A Harry passes quickly through the lengthening shadows of the empty corridor, when...
voice: Blood... I smell blood... Harry stops cold, looking around for the source of the voice.
voice: Let me rip you... let me kill you... Harry steps to the wall, playing his fingers along the stone, then begins walk, slowly at first, then more quickly, as if following something, moving faster and faster, rounding the corner and coming face to face with... Hermione and Ron.
environment: . 49A HERMIONE
hermione: Harry!
harry: Did you hear it?
ron: Hear what?
harry: That... voice.
hermione: Voice? What voice?
harry: (eyes darting around) I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just --
voice: Kill... Time to kill... As Harry stiffens, Hermione and Ron study him curiously.
harry: It's moving. I think it's going to... kill. Harry runs off. Hermione and Ron exchange a glance, follow.
environment: thru thru

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT 59 ... sleds to a stop, listening Nothing. Slowly, he peers down. WATER is oozing over the stone floor, surrounding his shoes. His own REFLECTION appears and, behind it, undulating like a dream... WORDS. Ron and Hermione come huffing up.
environment: . 59 RON
ron: Harry, what are you doing? He points. SHIMMERING on the wall are the words he saw reflected in water.
environment: ENEMIES OF THE HEIR... BEWARE.
hermione: 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?'
ron: What's that? Hanging underneath?
harry: That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris. The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket, eyes open and blank. Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent WINDOW near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up a silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the glass.
hermione: Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?
ron: (backing away) I... don't... like... spiders. Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, seconds later, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING... when they stop, seeing the wall and, standing before it, Harry, Ron and Hermione. A thudding SILENCE falls. Then Draco pushes forward, eyes the wall, and grins nastily.
draco: Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods! Draco's eyes find Hermione, just as Filch appears.
filch: What's going on here? Go on now! Make way... (stopping dead) Mrs. Norris! (rounding on Harry) You! You've murdered my cat! I'll kill you! I'll --
environment: . (2) 59 DUMBLEDORE
albus dumbledore: Argus! Dumbledore marches forward, trailed by a phalanx of teachers. Seeing the wall, Dumbledore's face darkens.
albus dumbledore: Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. (to Harry, Ron, Hermione) Everyone except you three. As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall and, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.
gilderoy lockhart: It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou. The full story's in my autobiography...
albus dumbledore: She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified.
gilderoy lockhart: Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't there. I know the very countercurse that could have spared her...
albus dumbledore: But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.
filch: (pointing at Harry) Ask him! It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall! Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a Squib.
harry: It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.
filch: Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell letter!
environment: . (3) 59 SNAPE
snape: If I might, Headmaster... The others turn, watch Snape separate from the shadows.
snape: Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time... Could Snape be defending Harry and the others blink. them?
snape: However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
gilderoy lockhart: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail... As Snape's lip curls in disgust, Hermione leaps in.
hermione: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when Harry said...
snape: (raising an eyebrow) Yes, Miss Granger?
harry: When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris. Snape eyes Harry coldly, knowing he's lying. Harry looks away... and finds Dumbledore studying him as well.
albus dumbledore: Innocent until proven guilty.
filch: My cat has been Petrified! I want to see some punishment!
environment: . (4) 59 DUMBLEDORE
albus dumbledore: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When they have matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. In the meantime, I advise caution. To all.
environment: 60A INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (A BIT LATER) 60A Harry, Ron and Hermione walk down the corridor.
ron: A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course. It's also why he hates students so much. He's bitter. Hermione, who's only been half-listening -- as if trying to unravel something in her mind -- speaks then.
hermione: Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?
harry: Yes.
hermione: And did he hear it?
harry: He said he didn't.
ron: Maybe he was lying.
hermione: I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald. Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.
environment: . 60A HARRY
harry: You do believe me, don't you?
hermione: 'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified.
harry: I can't explain it -- it was... scary. (frowning) D'you think I should've told them -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.
ron: Are you mad!
hermione: No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
environment: 62 INT. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING McGonagall stands before the class. Resting on the desk in front of each student, is a different animal. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Today, we will be turning animals into water goblets. She taps the bird in front of her, three times, with the tip of her wand. It transfigures into a beautiful crystal water goblet. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Now, who would like to go first... Mr. Weasley? Ron nods. He TAPS his rat, Scabbers, who turns into a goblet with a tail. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL You must replace that wand, Mr. Weasley. Ron nods sheepishly, looks at his broken wand.
environment: . (A1) 62
environment: McGonagall sees Hermione's raised hand. Her untouched animal. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Yes, Miss Granger?
hermione: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets? A HUSH falls over the class. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger.
hermione: Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing. Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement. McGonagall considers Hermione's question for a long moment, then nods. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age (CONTINUED)
environment: 54. 62
environment: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (CONT'D) Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Three of the founders co-existed quite harmoniously. One did not.
ron: Three glasses who? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. (a beat) According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
hermione: Muggle-borns. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Yes. Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a chamber. It has never been found.
hermione: Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin alone can control. It is said to be home... to a monster. Ron's eyes shift. Malfoy sits calmly, smiling to himself. . 63 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 63 Harry, Hermione, and Ron thread their way through the teeming corridor. Up ahead, Malfoy walks with Crabbe and Goyle.
ron: D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
hermione: Yes. Couldn't you tell McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
harry: But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...
hermione: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
ron: (in mock puzzlement) Let's think. Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum.
hermione: (eyeing Malfoy ahead) If you're talking about him --
ron: Of course! You heard him 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
hermione: I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?
harry: Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
ron: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...
environment: . 63 HERMIONE
hermione: No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would be dangerous. Very dangerous.
ron: When do we start? 64 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 64 In a dark nook, Harry, Ron and Hermione huddle round a book entitled Moste Potente Potions. The spotted pages are littered with DISTURBING ILLUSTRATIONS.
hermione: Here it is 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'
ron: You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
hermione: Yes.
ron: Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!
hermione: Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.
ron: Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.
environment: 57. 64 HARRY
harry: How long will it take to make?
hermione: A month.
harry: A month? But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
hermione: You didn't have to tell me that. 65 EXT. QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY 65 We join the Quidditch match in mid-game. The CROWD ROARS, watching as Slytherin Chasers, bent low over their new brooms, jet past the overmatched Gryffindors.
hagrid: Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's flyin' like they got dragon fire in their brooms... Ron fumes, looking as though he takes Slytherin's dominance personally. Taking Hagrid's GIANT BINOCULARS, he trains them on the FACULTY BOX -- where Lucius Malfoy sits next to Snape. Harry circles high above the pitch, searching for the Golden Snitch. Suddenly, Malfoy streaks by overhead.
draco: All right there, Scarhead? Harry turns, eyes Malfoy malevolently. Behind him, a BLUDGER drops INTO FRAME, begins to streak toward his head.
george: HARRY! WATCH OUT! Harry wheels and at the last possible moment, slips the WHISTLING Bludger. CRACK! George swoops down, BATS it away. Harry turns, watches it soar away, then blinks the Bludger turns, streaks right back at him. Harry JETS OFF.
environment: . 65 HAGRID
hagrid: (from the stands) Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a Rogue Bludger!
ron: Rogue Bludger?
hagrid: Look fer yerself! It's bin' tampered with! Harry executes a series of zigs, zags, loops and rolls, trying to shake the Bludger, but the Bludger is relentless. Ron instinctively draws his wand, begins to point it toward Harry and the Bludger, when... Hermione's hand intercedes. She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.
hermione: You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.
draco: Training for the ballet, Potter? Harry glances at Malfoy's sneering face. BUZZING inches above Malfoy's left ear is... the GOLDEN SNITCH. Harry CHARGES. Malfoy GULPS, swings clear, and watches Harry rocket past. As Harry chases the plummeting Snitch, Malfoy FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing the HISSING SNITCH deep into the TRENCH circling the pitch. Shoulder to shoulder, they RACE MADLY, driving and dodging the wooden support beams that crisscross their path. Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the BEAMS as it dogs Harry. Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the trench. Harry BRUSHES the wall, battling for control. Malfoy turns, SNICKERS, then looks back... and finds himself heading smack into a wooden beam. Panicked, he tries to pull up. Too late. Broom meets beam and Malfoy spirals out of the trench and -- THWUMP! -- flat on his back in the middle of the pitch.
environment: A. (1A) 65
environment: Harry continues on, CLOSING on the Snitch, fingertips only inches from catching it... when... the Rogue Bludger SMASHES INTO Harry's arm. Harry cries out, steadies himself and with a brilliant, acrobatic move, SNATCHES the Snitch out of the air with his good hand. Unable to control his broom with his shattered arm, he hits the pitch with a SICKENING THUD. Wincing, Harry rolls onto his shoulders, SQUINTS UP a BLACK DOT -- growing rapidly LARGER -- is plummeting from the sky, directly toward him. It's... the rogue Bludger. Instantly, Harry spins away, grimacing in agony, as the Bludger... ... hits the ground like a SLEDGE HAMMER, violently TATTOOING the pitch again and again, only inches from Harry. Calmly, Hermione strides forth, points her wand.
hermione: Finite Incantatem! The Bludger hangs briefly in the air. Slowly ceases spinning. Drops heavily to the pitch. Harry exhales, relieved, only to recall the searing pain in his arm. As CONCERNED FACES swim above him, one particular face pushes through the others
gilderoy lockhart: Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix that arm of yours straight away.
harry: No... no... not you.
environment: 59. (3) 65 GILDEROY LOCKHART
gilderoy lockhart: Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit... Lockhart TWIRLS his WAND, Harry braces himself, and... nothing. He blinks, looks up the faces -- which now include Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid -- look horror- stricken.
gilderoy lockhart: Ah. Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. The point is, the bones are no longer broken.
hagrid: Brok'n? He doesn't 'ave any bones at all! Harry looks his arm looks like an empty rubber glove. 66 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 66 A dazed Malfoy slumps out with Crabbe and Goyle. Ron, standing by Harry's bed with Hermione, grins, then watches MADAM POMFREY pour out a STEAMING BEAKERFUL OF LIQUID from a bottle of SKELE-GRO. A group of Gryffindors, including some of his teammates, stand nearby.
madam pomfrey: He should have been brought straight to me! I can mend bones in a heartbeat -- but growing them back --
hermione: You will be able to, won't you?
madam pomfrey: I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is nasty business. Harry takes the steaming cup and drinks. Grimaces.
madam pomfrey: Well, what did you expect -- pumpkin juice? FLASH! Harry blinks, sees Colin Creevey standing there.

colin: That was brilliant today, Harry! Brilliant!
madam pomfrey: Out! All of you! This boy's got thirty-three bones to regrow! 67 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT 67 Harry fidgets in the darkness, half-asleep, then... his eyelids flutter slowly open... HARRY'S MOVING POV From the shadows that cling to the ceiling... to the lattice-work of moonlight that burns softly on the walls around him...

dobby: At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see --
harry: Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
environment: 61. 67 DOBBY
dobby: Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. (waggling his fingers) Dobby had to iron his hands...
harry: You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
dobby: (smiling weakly) Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
harry: I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
dobby: Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He Who Must Not Be Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin... Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.
harry: Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
dobby: This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the house elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. The family is careful not to pass Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever. Dobby's ears QUIVER, detecting... FOOTSTEPS. He WHISPERS.
dobby: Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter must not stay here now that history is to repeat itself!
environment: . (2) 67 HARRY
harry: Repeat itself? You mean, this has happened before? Dobby seizes the Skele-Gro, BEATS himself about the head.
harry: Tell me, Dobby? When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?
dobby: Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
harry: Who is it? No, Dobby! Tell me! CRACK! Dobby is gone. SHADOWS flicker beyond the CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed. Harry slumps down... peers through a slit in the curtains. Dumbledore, in a nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL STATUE onto an empty bed. Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey bustles in.
madam pomfrey: What's happened?
albus dumbledore: There's been another attack. Madam Pomfrey GASPS. It is not a statue lying there. It is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker... Dumbledore opens the camera. A JET OF STEAM HISSES forth. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What does this mean, Albus?
albus dumbledore: It means our students are in great danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was fortunate. If not for this... (holding up the camera) He would surely be dead.
environment: A. (3) 67
environment: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What sould I tell the staff, Albus?
albus dumbledore: Tell them the truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell them it's as we feared. The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.
environment: 68A EXT. GIRLS BATHROOM 68A We PAN SLOWLY FROM the defiled wall to the bathroom door. 63. 69 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DAY 69 A gloomy place. Cracked mirrors. Chipped sinks. Guttering candles. Harry and Ron huddle over a SMALL, BUBBLING CAULDRON, as Hermione adds STRANGE INGREDIENTS.
hermione: Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
ron: Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it.
hermione: Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
ron: Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?
hermione: Never. No one over comes in here.
ron: Why?
hermione: Moaning Myrtle.
ron: Who's Moaning Myrtle? There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A YOUNG GIRL COMES RACING OUT OF THE WALL. FACE TO FACE with Ron.
moaning myrtle: I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle? Myrtle SOBS LOUDLY, DIVES head first into the toilet.
hermione: She's a little sensitive. 64. 70 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 70
notice-board: DUELING CLUB! First Meeting Tonight. A GOLDEN STAGE has been erected. Lockhart struts atop it. Harry, Ron, Hermione and good number of other students watch.
gilderoy lockhart: Gather round! Gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club, to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions -- for full details, see my published works. The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to him.
justin finch-fletchley: That Lockhart's something, isn't he? Awfully brave chap. (offering his hand) Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.
harry: Nice to meet you. I'm --
justin finch-fletchley: I know who you are. We all do. Even us Muggle-borns. Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, where Professor Snape has joined Lockhart.
gilderoy lockhart: Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him, never fear!
ron: What's the fun in that? Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow. They turn, walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords.
environment: . 70 GILDEROY LOCKHART
gilderoy lockhart: As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position. On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.
harry: (eyeing Snape) I wouldn't bet on that.
gilderoy lockhart: One-two-three --
snape: Expelliarmus! A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS Lockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.
hermione: Do you think he's all right?
harry: Who cares?
ron: Who cares?
gilderoy lockhart: (rising unsteadily) Well, there you have it. That was a Disarming Charm. As you see, I've lost my wand.
gilderoy lockhart: (as Hermione returns it) Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy...
snape: Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
environment: 66. (2) 70 GILDEROY LOCKHART
gilderoy lockhart: An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?
snape: Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy, perhaps. Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they take their places onstage. Grudgingly, they bow to each other.
draco: Scared, Potter?
harry: You wish. They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.
gilderoy lockhart: Wands at the ready! When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent -- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents. One, two -- Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with a BLAST of WHITE LIGHT. He jumps up, points his wand.
harry: Rictusempra! A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach. He doubles up, WHEEZING.
gilderoy lockhart: I said disarm only!
draco: Serpensortia! To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth. Snape smiles with amusement.
environment: 67. (3) 70 SNAPE
snape: Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
gilderoy lockhart: Allow me! Lockhart flicks his wand. BANG! The SNAKE flies into the air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towards Justin Finch-Fletchley. As students SCREAM, Harry -- oddly calm -- approaches the snake. It rises, fangs exposed, poised to strike Justin.
harry: (in Parseltongue) Leave him! The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.
harry: (in Parseltongue) LEAVE HIM! The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously -- slumps to the floor. Harry blinks, as if coming out of a trance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his hand to Justin.
justin finch-fletchley: What are you playing at? Terrified, Justin backs away. Confused, Harry eyes the faces around him. Malfoy looks shocked. Seamus and Neville's eyes glitter with fear. Ginny bolts the room. Snape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF OF BLACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is both shrewd and calculating.
ron: (taking Harry's arm) Come on. Move. Now. 71 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - DAY (LATER) 71 Ron and Hermione usher Harry inside. Harry glances up, sees Ginny Weasley staring down at him from the top of the stairs. As their eyes meet, she turns for the girls' dormitory.
ron: You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?
environment: 68. 71 HARRY
harry: I'm a what?
hermione: You can talk to snakes.
harry: I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
hermione: No. They can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
harry: What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin --
ron: Oh, that's what you said to it.
harry: You were there! You heard me!
ron: I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.
harry: I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
hermione: I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy. As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harry warily. Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by without a word.
hermione: Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.
environment: 69. (2) 71 RON
ron: Exactly. And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.
harry: But I'm not. I... can't be.
hermione: He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know... you could be. 72 EXT. HOGWARTS' LANDSCAPE - DAY 72 A heavy snow falls. Harry sits atop one of the towering hills facing Hogwarts. Hedwig sits beside him.
harry: Who am I, Hedwig? What am I? 73 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 73 The trio study. Harry, burdened by dark thoughts, looks up at Ron. He smiles at Harry, then, seconds later, Hermione does the same -- something forced about it all. Unable to bear it, Harry gathers his books, gets up from the table. As Harry walks, students glance up, meet his gaze, then look away. Even MADAM PINCE eyes him from her desk. Ginny Weasley, tired and pale, scribbles furiously in a SMALL BLACK BOOK. Harry exits, walks into the hallway and pauses. From inside a room, the VOICES of a group of Hufflepuffs can be heard.
ernie: So, anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best he keep a low profile for a while.
hannah: But why would he want to attack Justin?
environment: . 73 ERNIE
ernie: Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggle-born.
hannah: And you definitely think Potter's the Heir of Slytherin?
ernie: Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue. (whispering darkly) Remember what was written on the wall Enemies of the Heir Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch's cat's attacked. That first-year Creevey's been annoying Potter. Then Creevey's attacked.
hannah: He always seems so nice, though. And, after all, he is the one who made You Know Who disappear.
ernie: That's probably why You Know Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him. Harry doesn't need to hear anymore. He slips quietly away. 74 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 74 MUTTERING, Harry storms straight into Hagrid, who stands covered in snow, a DEAD ROOSTER dangling from his hand.
hagrid: All righ', Harry?
harry: Hagrid... what're you doing here?
environment: . 74 HAGRID
hagrid: (holding up the rooster) Second one killed this term. Reckon it's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear. Need Dumbledore's permission ter put a charm round the hen-coop. Yeh sure yeh're all righ', Harry? Yeh look all hot an' bothered.
harry: It's nothing. I'd better get going. I've got a lot of studying... 75 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 75 Harry enters, slows. Up ahead, in the light of a FLICKERING TORCH, something DARK lies. A WINDOWPANE RATTLES in the WIND and the torch... goes out. Harry steps closer, finds... Justin-Finch-Fletchley. Lying rigid on the floor, a look of shock on his frozen face. Nearby, an inert Nearly Headless Nick floats, body teeming with BLACK SMOKE. Kneeling, Harry notices a TRAIL OF SPIDERS scuttling away from Justin's body and out the loose windowpane... when suddenly... ... Harry senses someone watching him, wheels McGonagall.
harry: Professor, I swear I didn't -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This is out of my hands, Potter. Mr. Filch, will you take care of this, please? Harry's eyes shift. Filch lurks in the shadows beyond McGonagall. He steps forward, HISSES QUIETLY.
filch: Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words... As McGonagall leads Harry away, he looks back. Filch stares at Justin and Nick, then turns. CAMERA DOLLYS AWAY FROM HIM.
environment: . 75 FILCH
filch: Dark magic. That's what you've got, Potter. Even the air you breathe comes out poison. You're evil. Evil as they come... 76 INT. GARGOYLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 76 McGonagall marches Harry down to an UGLY STONE GARGOYLE. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Sherbet lemon. The Gargoyle SPRINGS TO LIFE, its wings opening. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. McGonagall ushers Harry inside. It's an elevator. The Gargoyle's wings close. Harry rises to an upper floor. 77 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 77 Harry steps out of the Gargoyle's embrace and enters a large, circular room. STRANGE SILVER INSTRUMENTS WHIR quietly. On a nearby shelf, the SORTING HAT sits. Harry casts a wary eye at the PAST HEADMASTERS snoozing in the PORTRAITS around him. In the last portrait, the Headmaster is awake, reading a book. He is PROFESSOR DIPPET. Harry approaches the Sorting Hat, glances around, then places it atop his head.
sorting hat: Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
harry: Well, you see, I was wondering...
environment: 73. 77 SORTING HAT
sorting hat: If I put you in the right house? Yes... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said last year... you would have done well in Slytherin. Harry strips the hat off, tosses it back onto the shelf.
harry: You're wrong! The hat sits motionless. Silent. Hearing a GAGGING SOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES) sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH. It wobbles, then... BURSTS INTO FLAMES. As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror- struck.
harry: Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire.
albus dumbledore: About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day. He's really very handsome most of the time. (off Harry's look) Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Harry looks to the floor. The ASHES swirl. A baby Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the dust.
albus dumbledore: Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster -- BURSTS through the door.
hagrid: It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore!
environment: . (2) 77 DUMBLEDORE
albus dumbledore: Hagrid --
hagrid: I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found. It can't've bin 'im!
albus dumbledore: Hagrid --
hagrid: I'll swear ter it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic --
albus dumbledore: HAGRID! I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.
hagrid: Oh. Right. I'll wait outside then. As Hagrid exits, Harry looks hopefully at Dumbledore.
harry: You don't think it was me, Professor?
albus dumbledore: No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me. Anything at all? Dumbledore waits. Harry debates. Finally...
harry: No, Professor. Nothing. 78 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY 78 Students drift into the snow with their trunks, heading home for holiday. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear, Ernie and few others cast wary glances.
fred: Make way for the Heir of Slytherin! Seriously evil wizard coming through! Ron grins, amused, then sees Harry -- anything but.
environment: . 78 RON
ron: Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh.
harry: He's the only one.
ron: Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?
harry: Maybe they're right.
hermione: (reproachfully) Harry!
harry: (frustrated) I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue. What else don't I know about myself? Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.
hermione: You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.
ron: Why would that make anyone feel better?
hermione: Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin. 79 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 79 The Christmas Feast. The Hall glimmers grandly as snowflakes tumble from the ceiling. Harry and Ron sit with Hermione.
environment: A. (A1) 79 HERMIONE
hermione: Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
harry: Crabbe and Goyle.
hermione: And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
ron: How? Hermione holds up a pair of SMALL CAKES.
hermione: I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Ron glances at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who presently are eating everything in front of them.
hermione: You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are. They won't leave the Christmas Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone. (CONTINUED)
environment: . 79
environment: HERMIONE (CONT'D) Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs.
ron: And whose hair are you ripping out?
hermione: I've already got mine. She removes a SMALL VIAL. Inside is a TINY HAIR.
hermione: Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes. (rising) All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion. Hermione points to the cakes in front of her.
hermione: Remember. Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these. Hermione exits. Ron looks at Harry.
ron: Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong? 80 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (A BIT LATER) 80 Harry and Ron, lurking behind a SUIT OF ARMOR, watch Crabbe and Goyle exit the Great Hall. Goyle spies the cakes instantly, perched on the end of one of the banisters. Grabbing them, he reluctantly surrenders one to Crabbe and, in unison, they stuff them into their mouths. They pause. Look at each other. And keel flat onto their backs. Harry and Ron dash out, drag Crabbe and Goyle across the floor and into a cupboard. 81 INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 81 Hermione, wearing a Slytherin robe, hovers over a smoking cauldron. Harry and Ron enter.
environment: A. 81 HERMIONE
hermione: Did you get it? Harry and Ron hold up their hands. In each a TUFT OF HAIR. Hermione points to a pair of SLYTHERIN ROBES.
hermione: I sneaked those out of the laundry. Harry and Ron nod, glance at the cauldron. The potion resembles a thick, dark, bubbling mud.
environment: 77. 81 HERMIONE
hermione: I'm sure I've done everything right. It looks like the book said it should. Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
ron: Now what?
hermione: We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs. Harry and Ron grimace. CLOSEUP - THE POTION
environment: being poured into three glasses. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Harry and Ron have changed into the Slytherin robes. All three raise their glasses. Drop the hairs. The potion turns shades of YELLOW, BROWN, and KHAKI.
ron: Ugh. Essence of Crabbe... They nod. DRINK. Ron swallows grimly, doubles over.
ron: Think I'm gonna be sick... He runs into a stall. Harry looks sick, steps to a CRACKED MIRROR. Hermione pauses. Looks worried. Something's wrong... INSIDE THE STALL Ron bends over the toilet, watches his reflection morph into Crabbe. IN THE CRACKED MIRROR Harry watches his face contort into the thick features of Goyle. Hermione looks at her arm. Patches of fur begin to spread across her wrist and hand. Terrified, she RUNS into a stall. Ron emerges from his stall, a dead ringer for Crabbe.
environment: 78. (2) 81 RON
ron: Harry?
harry: Ron?
ron: Bloody hell.
harry: We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
ron: (adjusts voice) Bloody hell.
harry: Lower.
ron: (lower still) Bloody hell.
harry: Less intelligent.
ron: (dumbing it down) Bloody hell.
harry: Excellent.
ron: Hey... Where's Hermione? HERMIONE (O.S.) (from the stall) I -- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me.
harry: Hermione, are you okay? HERMIONE (O.S.) Just go! You're wasting time!
environment: . 83 EXT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 83 Harry and Ron hurry down the staircase.
ron: Don't swing your arms like that. Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. Harry goes a bit more "Neanderthal."
ron: Yeah. That's better.
environment: Harry and Ron move quickly, when... FOOTSTEPS sound. Seconds later, Percy appears at the end of the corridor.
ron: What are you doing here? Percy squints, confused by Ron's voice. Harry elbows Ron, who clears his throat and speaks in a lower voice.
ron: What are you doing here?
percy: I happen to be a prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. It's not safe these days. Harry and Ron NOD, afraid to speak. Percy squints again.
percy: What're your names again?
draco: Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Draco is walking towards them, glances witheringly at Percy.
draco: And what are you doing down here, Weasley?
percy: Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You want to show a little bit more respect to a school Prefect!
environment: 80. 84 DRACO
draco: Come on, boys. Weasley thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's hair single-handed. Percy steams. Draco sneers, walks off with Harry and Ron.
environment: 86 INT. SLYTHERIN COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 86 Harry and Ron trail Draco inside, glance around warily.
draco: Listen to this... Draco grabs The Daily Prophet, reads the front page.
draco: 'Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. "Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts. "He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately."' Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.
draco: Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so much he should snap his wand in half and go join them. You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. Embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. Ron growls. Harry elbows him. Draco looks surprised.
draco: What's up with you, Crabbe?
ron: (low voice) Stomachache.
environment: 81. 86 DRACO
draco: Well, go to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick in the arse for me! You know, I'm surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet. I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father always said Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place.
harry: You're wrong!
draco: What? Did you say that I was wrong? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Ron stiffens. Worried. Harry thinks, then
harry: Harry Potter.
draco: (grinning) Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that Mudblood Granger. And people actually think he's the Heir of Slytherin. Harry and Ron exchange a glance. Harry leans closer to Draco.
harry: Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?
draco: You know I haven't, Goyle. How many times do I have to tell you? But my father did say this much It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it -- only that they were expelled -- but I know this the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. (CONTINUED)
environment: 82. (2) 86
environment: DRACO (CONT'D) So it's only a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. As for me... I hope it's Granger. As Malfoy grins, Ron's fist rises... when Harry stops him.
draco: What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd.
ron: Ho! Harry turns, sees Ron staring wide-eyed Harry's SCAR is beginning to surface beneath the skin of Goyle's thick forehead. And Crabbe's hair is... turning RED. They both JUMP to their feet, DASHING out of the room.
draco: Hey! Where are you going? 87 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 87 As Harry and Ron race toward the stairs, the BROOM CLOSET bursts open and a woozy Crabbe and Goyle stagger out. They freeze -- watch themselves run up the staircase. 88 INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 88 Harry and Ron sprint toward the desecrated wall, their bodies metamorphosing, until, finally, as they hit the door... 89 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT 89 ... They are fully themselves once more.
ron: That was close!
harry: Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!
hermione: Go away!
environment: . 89
environment: As Harry and Ron exchange a puzzled glance, Moaning Myrtle spirals INTO VIEW, looking disturbingly... happy.
moaning myrtle: Ooh, wait till you see. It's awful! The stall's lock slides back. The door opens slowly. HERMIONE (O.S.) Do you remember me telling you the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations...? Even in shadow, they can see Hermione's face is covered in FUR, her eyes YELLOW, and POINTED EARS poke through her hair.
hermione: It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look at my face!
ron: Look at your tail. 90 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY (TWO WEEKS LATER) 90 Staggering under the weight of the LIBRARY BOOKS in their arms, Harry and Ron make their way to Hermione's bed, which is covered in... BOOKS.
hermione: Oh, good. Put those anywhere. They look. There is no anywhere. So they just... drop them.
ron: Madam Pince asked that we relay a message to you, Hermione She'd appreciate it if you'd leave a few books for the rest of the school.
hermione: I've got to keep up, haven't I? Just then, Hermione's tail twitches INTO VIEW.
ron: Is that thing ever going away?
environment: . 90 HERMIONE
hermione: Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.
ron: We all are, believe me.
hermione: Now. What about the Chamber of Secrets? Any new leads?
harry: Nothing.
hermione: And has it gotten any better? I mean... is anyone speaking to you?
harry: Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday. I suppose that's something. Ron takes a GET-WELL CARD from under Hermione's pillow.
ron: 'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow?
hermione: Of course not. I don't know how that got there. Now go. I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages.
environment: 92 EXT. SECOND-FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 92 Harry and Ron mount the stairs, emerge.
ron: I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?
environment: A. 92
environment: They stop. Look down. A GREAT FLOOD OF WATER streams from the Girls' Bathroom. From within, MYRTLE can be heard MOANING.
harry: Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. As Harry sploshes off toward the bathroom, Ron steps lightly.
ron: Yuck. 93 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 93 HUGE, WRACKING MOANS echo off the dreary tile. All the taps are running, streaming like tiny waterfalls. As Harry and Ron step to the last cubicle, Myrtle spins accusingly.
environment: 85. 93 MOANING MYRTLE
moaning myrtle: Come to throw something else at me?
harry: Why would I throw something at you?
moaning myrtle: Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me...
ron: But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?
moaning myrtle: Oh sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach. Fifty points if it goes through her head!
harry: Who threw it at you anyway?
moaning myrtle: I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head. Harry sees a SMALL BLACK BOOK on the floor. Picks it up.
ron: Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.
moaning myrtle: I HEARD THAT! Harry and Ron dash out. 94 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 94 Harry examines the book as he and Ron walk.
harry: This is a diary. And it's old...
environment: . 94 RON
ron: It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry. Harry starts to open it... when Ron grabs his hand.
ron: Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.
harry: I'll take my chances... (opening it) Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES! Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the ruse. At the end of corridor, Ginny stands, looking from the diary to Harry -- utter terror on her face -- then dashes off.
harry: Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.
ron: Who doesn't? Ron frowns suddenly. On the first page on the diary, EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.
ron: Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name... (thinking, then) Of course! The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room. I remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy. I must have wiped slime off his name for an hour. Harry fans the pages. They're empty.
harry: That's odd. He never wrote in it. 95 INT. HOSPITAL WING - LATER THAT NIGHT 95
environment: DIARY. A GOLD EMBOSSED ADDRESS on the back reads WAXFLATTER'S BOOKSELLERS. 422 VAUXHALL ROAD.
environment: . 95
environment: CAMERA PULLS BACK. Harry sits with Hermione in the moonlit room. Hermione studies the diary curiously.
hermione: Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago?
harry: Special Services to the School or something --
hermione: Fifty years ago? You're sure?
harry: Yes. Why?
hermione: Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --
harry: Fifty years ago! That means --
hermione: Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened. What if he wrote about what he saw? It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it. If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?
harry: That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.
hermione: It might be invisible ink. (pulls out her wand) Aparecium! She taps the diary three times. Nothing happens. The pages remain BLANK. She frowns, passes the book back to Harry.
environment: . (2) 95 HERMIONE
hermione: I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous.
harry: You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione? I mean, you're not scared. Of me.
hermione: I'm scared, Harry. But not of you. 96 INT. GRYFFINDOR DORMITORY/COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 96 CAMERA STARTS OVERHEAD, looking down on the boys' dormitory. Seamus, Neville, Ron and Dean sleep. One bed is empty. CAMERA CRANES TO the Common Room, finds Harry sitting alone, flipping through the blank pages of the diary. Harry starts to set the diary aside, then notices a BOTTLE OF INK sitting on the desk. An idea flickers. Taking his QUILL, Harry dips it, and hesitates. As he does, a DROP of INK hangs, suspended like a tear, then... DROPS. The ink BLAZES briefly, then... VANISHES... as if it were sucked into the page. Excited, Harry dips his quill again, and, this time, writes My name is Harry Potter. The words blaze, VANISH. Slowly, oozing out of the page, comes a response Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. Harry's mind races. Deciding, he MUTTERS the words he writes
harry: Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets? Yes.
harry: Can... you... tell... me? No.
environment: . 96
environment: Harry frowns. Then... slowly... new words ooze to the surface. But I can show you... Harry waits, intrigued. Then, suddenly... The pages FLUTTER WILDLY, stop on "June the 13th." On the page, a TINY SQUARE SHIMMERS... like a WINDOW. Harry lifts the book, puts his eye close and... PITCHES FORWARD, spilling through the widening window, into a WHIRL of COLOR and SHADOW, tumbling onto his feet... 97 INT. CORRIDOR/ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (FIFTY YEARS AGO) 97 ... in torch-lit corridor. Everything is de-saturated, save for Harry, who retains the true, rich colors of the present. He glances about, disoriented, then spies a BOY (TOM RIDDLE) at the end of the corridor, peering around a corner. A FLURRY of SHADOWS dances on the wall beyond the boy, revealing the presence of others, unseen, in an adjoining room. As Harry advances, LOW VOICES emanate from the shadows. As he reaches the boy, Harry speaks in a WHISPER
harry: Excuse me. Could you tell me where I am? Hello...? The boy doesn't respond, eyes staked to the activity in the adjoining room... which Harry sees now is the Entrance Hall. A group of ELDER WITCHES and WIZARDS -- Hogwarts Professors -- talk amongst themselves, then... abruptly go silent. Make way for two YOUNG WIZARDS, bearing a STRETCHER. VOICE (O.S.) Riddle. The boy wheels... and looks right through Harry. Harry turns, too. It's Dumbledore... fifty years younger.
tom riddle: Professor Dumbledore.
albus dumbledore: It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.
environment: . 97 TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if... Riddle glances toward the young wizards, watches them carry the stretcher out of the Hall, into the night.
tom riddle: ... the rumors were true.
albus dumbledore: I'm afraid they are, Tom.
tom riddle: About the school as well? They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?
albus dumbledore: Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid.
tom riddle: Sir? If it all stopped. If the person responsible was caught...
albus dumbledore: Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?
tom riddle: (a long beat) No, sir. Nothing. Dumbledore studies Riddle for a moment.
albus dumbledore: Very well then. Hurry along. Dumbledore strides directly past Harry, not seeing him. When he is gone, Riddle moves quickly, toward the dungeon steps.
environment: &amp; &amp;
environment: 100 INT. CORRIDOR - DUNGEONS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 100 Up ahead, a SPLINTER of LIGHT leaks through a DOOR. Riddle puts his eye to the crack. Inside, someone is SPEAKING.
environment: . 100
environment: VOICE (O.S.) C'mon, Aragog. Gotta get yeh outta here... C'mon now.. in the box... As Riddle pushes the door clear, Harry sees a second, smaller room. Crouched by a BOX, is a huge boy... YOUNG HAGRID. A STRANGE CLICKING comes from the BOX.
tom riddle: Evening, Hagrid. Hagrid SLAMS the door shut.
tom riddle: I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone --
hagrid: No, yeh can't! Yeh don' understand!
tom riddle: Hagrid. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
hagrid: It wasn' him! Aragog never'd kill no one! Never!
tom riddle: Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now... stand aside... Riddle draws his wand, BLASTS the closed DOOR off its hinges, extinguishing the torches within. Harry GASPS. A low-slung CREATURE with a tangle of black legs, a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers, scuttles out of the shadows. As Riddle points his wand at it, Hagrid LEAPS...
hagrid: Noooooo!
environment: . (2) 100
environment: As they tumble to the floor, the entire ROOM WHIRLS off its axis, spinning, and Harry finds himself plummeting through color and shadow again, falling flat on his back to... ... the floor of the Gryffindor Common Room, the ceiling above spinning, slowly, to a stop. Harry rises, dashes upstairs. 100A INT. BOYS' DORMITORY - NIGHT 100A Harry rushes to Ron, shakes him awake, WHISPERING INTENSELY.
harry: Ron! Ron!
ron: What? What's happened...?
harry: It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago. 100B EXT. HOGWARTS - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY 100B CAMERA SOARS high over the castle, as below, students hurry to their classes. Finally, it FINDS
environment: 102 EXT./INT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY (LATER) 102 Harry, Ron and Hermione walking together across the grounds.
hermione: It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
ron: We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
harry: The monster had killed someone, Ron. What would any of us done?
hermione: Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it?
environment: . 102 RON
ron: That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
hagrid: Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh? The trio wheels, spots Hagrid grinning at them. They instantly look guilty.
harry: No! Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.
ron: No! Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.
hermione: No! Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.
harry: What's that you've got, Hagrid?
hagrid: Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer the Mandrakes, yeh know. Accordin' ter Professor Sprout, they still got a bit o' growin' up ter do, but once their acne clears up, we'll be able to chop 'em up, stew 'em, an' get those people in the hospital un-Petrified. 'Til then, you three best watch yerselves, all righ'? They nod, watch Hagrid lope away. Just then, Neville comes running up. He looks pale with fright.
neville: Harry, I don't know who did it, but... you'd better come. .
environment: 104 INT. GRYFFINDOR TOWER DORMITORY - DAY 104 Harry's space is a disaster trunk riffled, drawers flung open, bedclothes strewn on the floor.
hermione: It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it wasn't a student...
environment: . 104 RON
ron: Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.
harry: And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone. 105 EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY 105 Students stream into the Quidditch Stadium. 105A INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - DAY 105A Harry, dressed in his Quidditch robes, dashes down the staircase with Ron and Hermione. Down below, Ron spies Ginny.
ron: Hey, Ginny! Going to the match? Ginny looks up, startled, then shakes her head and exits.
ron: I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day... VOICE (O.S.) Kill this time... Let me rip... Tear. Harry freezes. Ron and Hermione stop, knowing by his face...
ron: No... don't tell me... Harry turns, as if following the SOUND, absently touching his fingers to the wall as he glances around. Hermione studies him with great interest -- STUDIES HIS FINGERS -- then, abruptly, Harry turns away, shakes his head it's gone. Hermione looks up, eyes vaguely upon Harry, but her mind miles away.
hermione: Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library! As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS.
harry: What do you understand!
environment: THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 96. 105A
environment: But she's gone. Harry turns to Ron in puzzlement.
harry: The library?
ron: That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library 106 EXT. REAR OF QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY (LATER) 106 Harry and his teammates march toward the Quidditch tower. The CHEERS of the CROWD are heard.
wood: Listen up now. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker, smarter.
george: Not to mention they're dead terrified Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
wood: That, too. Just then, Professor McGonagall appears, barring their way.
wood: Professor McGonagall -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This match has been cancelled.
wood: Cancelled! They can't cancel Quidditch -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Silence, Wood! You will return to Gryffindor Tower now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you need to see. 107 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 107 McGonagall pauses outside the door, turns to Harry and Ron.
environment: THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 97. 107
environment: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL I warn you. This will be a bit of a shock. She opens the door. Madam Pomfrey is leaning over a bed where a girl lies. As she straightens up, we see the girl is...
ron: Hermione! PROFESSOR McGONAGALL She was found near the library. Along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you? She holds up a SMALL CIRCULAR MIRROR. Harry shakes his head. McGonagall nods gravely, leads them out. As they go, the CAMERA DRIFTS to HERMIONE'S HAND. Clinched tight in her stiff knuckles, barely visible, is... a PIECE OF PAPER. 108 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 108 McGonagall reads from a PARCHMENT to the somber Gryffindors. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock in the evening. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. (rolling up the parchment) I should tell you all this. Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely that the school will be closed. McGonagall turns, exits. Instantly, as one, the students begin to talk amongst themselves. Neville speaks up.
neville: Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin -- why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?
environment: THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 98. 108 SEAMUS
seamus: They can't close Hogwarts. Where would we all go?
dean thomas: I don't care what anyone says. As long as Dumbledore's here, Hogwarts will be here. Harry WHISPERS to Ron.
harry: We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. And that's a start.
ron: But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --
harry: I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again. 109 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (LATER) 109
environment: A drawer opens, a HAND reaches in, takes the INVISIBILITY CLOAK. CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Ron and Harry. All around them, the other boys sleep. Harry pitches the cloak over himself and Ron. They're gone.
environment: &amp; &amp;
environment: 112 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 112 Harry and Ron, beneath the cloak, sneak by an unaware Snape.
environment: 99. 113 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 113 A KNOCK. Hagrid swings open the door. Crossbow in hand.
hagrid: Who's there? Harry and Ron drop the cloak. Hagrid lowers the crossbow. 114 INT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 114 FANG, Hagrid's enormous BOARHOUND, THUMPS HIS TAIL at the sight of Harry and Ron. Harry points to the crossbow.
harry: What's that for?
hagrid: Nothin', nothin'. I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit down... I'll make tea... Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..
harry: Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?
hagrid: Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'.
harry: Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets? Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer, when... there is a LOUD KNOCK. The fruitcake SMASHES to the floor. Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over themselves. Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points it at the door.
hagrid: C-come in. The door opens. A grim Dumbledore enters, followed by a portly man in a pin-stripe suit and bowler
cornelius fudge: FUDGE.
albus dumbledore: Good evening, Hagrid.
environment: 100. 114 RON
ron: (whispering to Harry) That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge. The Minister of Magic! Harry elbows Ron to shut him up.
cornelius fudge: Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.
hagrid: I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...
albus dumbledore: I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.
cornelius fudge: Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's against him. I've got to take him.
hagrid: Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.
cornelius fudge: For a short stretch only. Not a punishment, Hagrid. More a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be released with a full apology. Just then, there is a SHARP RAP on the door. As Dumbledore opens it, Harry slumps. It's Lucius Malfoy.
lucius malfoy: Already here, Fudge? Good, good...
hagrid: What're you doin' here! Get outta my house!
environment: 101. (2) 114 LUCIUS MALFOY
lucius malfoy: My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the Headmaster was here.
albus dumbledore: And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?
lucius malfoy: Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. What with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts. And we all know what an awful loss that would be. Malfoy hands Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT.
cornelius fudge: Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore suspended. No, no... last thing we want right now... If Dumbledore can't stop these attacks... I mean to say, who can?
lucius malfoy: That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted --
hagrid: An' how many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed!
lucius malfoy: I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that.
hagrid: Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin's next!
environment: 102. (3) 114 DUMBLEDORE
albus dumbledore: Calm yourself, Hagrid! (steely-eyed) If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it. Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.
lucius malfoy: Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um, killin's. Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid. Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath and says carefully...
hagrid: If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow the spiders. That'd lead 'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'. Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him out. As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL, scratching at the closed door. Harry and Ron emerge from the cloak.
ron: Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
harry: Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.
harry: C'mon. 103.
environment: thru thru
environment: 119 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 119 Harry illuminates the TRAIL OF SPIDERS. They run from the window to the ground, to the dark trees in the near distance. As Harry moves to follow, Ron hesitates.
ron: What are you doing?
harry: You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.
ron: They're heading into the Dark Forest. Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang, follows.
ron: Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?
environment: 121 EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT 121 Fang crashes through low-slung branches and sharp brambles as Harry follows. Ron gingerly picks his way, the JUMPS... as FANG HOWLS. BRANCHES SNAP. A RUMBLING NOISE sounds, then... SILENCE. Harry spies something, points O.S.
harry: There's something moving over there... something big. Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding them. They start to flee... when Ron stops.
ron: Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.
environment: THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 104. 121 HARRY
harry: It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild. Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.
harry: C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail. 121A EXT. SPIDERS' HOLLOW - NIGHT 121A Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows. Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off queasily. Harry peers up ahead at the far end of the hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING. As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about nervously.
ron: I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --
harry: Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.
environment: An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG), the size of a small elephant. As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away. Then its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS. As if... listening.
aragog: You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like... men.
harry: (breathing finally) Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... (as it comes to him) ... Aragog, aren't you?
environment: THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 105. 121A
environment: Hearing this, Aragog's head turns slightly.
aragog: Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
harry: He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then... RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left. Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.
aragog: That's a lie! Hagrid never opend the Chamber of Secrets!
harry: But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.
aragog: The monster was born in the castle. I came from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler. Ron turns. TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward. Pause. Waiting. Watching.
ron: Harry...
harry: Shhh! (to Aragog) But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
aragog: We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
harry: But have you seen it?
environment: THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 106. (2) 121A
environment: A SCRABBLING SOUND ECHOES above Ron. He GLANCES UP a SPIDER crouches on a branch above.
aragog: I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. More SCRABBLING. Ron looks up. We PAN UP with him. SEE SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING DOWNWARD like paratroopers. Ron GRABS Harry.
harry: (annoyed) What! Ron points. Harry looks. Pales. Turns slowly back to Aragog.
harry: Well... thank you. We'll just go...
aragog: Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid. Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.
ron: Can we panic now? CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again SPIDERS. Everywhere. CLOSING IN. Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand. The spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of the LIGHT chases itself away. Around and around. Then The LANTERN goes out. Harry pitches it aside. As one, he and Ron draw their wands.
ron: Nice knowing you.
environment: A. (3) 121A
environment: They're done for. Fang WHIMPERS. The spiders draw closer, CLICKING FEVERISHLY, when... ... a LONG, LOUD HORN BLEATS. Seconds later, a BLAZE of LIGHT ignites the hollow and the FORD ANGLIA comes THUNDERING over the rim and down the slope, KNOCKING SPIDERS OUT OF ITS PATH. As it SCREECHES to a halt, the DOORS FLING OPEN.
harry: Let's go! Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY. A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.
harry: THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!
ron: (trying) I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK! Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window. Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE. Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows hold tight. As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his SPIDER'S LEGS. 121B EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT 121B The Anglia jets out of the hollow, lands with a THUD. Harry turns. The other spider is PULLING RON from the car. Harry points his wand, utters a spell and a BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT BLASTS the spider into the shadows whipping past.
ron: Thanks for that.
environment: 107. 121B HARRY
harry: Don't mention it. They stop. Both hear it a DISTANT CLICKING. As the car flies over a ridge, they see them a SEA OF SPIDERS heading straight for them like a herd of raging wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders STAMPEDE after. 121C EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK - NIGHT 121C The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead, SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one narrow escape route.
harry: That way! It's the only way out! (looking back) Hurry! They're catching up! Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as good as dead.
harry: Can you get us in the air?
ron: (jostling the gear stick) Flying gear's jammed! The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing tarantula, then sails over the trees. 121D EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 121D As they LAND, Fang bolts free. Harry and Ron exit the CAR wearily, then watch it turn and RUMBLE BACK INTO THE FOREST.
environment: . 121D RON
ron: 'Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
harry: We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
environment: thru thru
environment: 123 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 123 Madam Pomfrey bars the door, frowns at Harry and Ron.
madam pomfrey: There's no point in talking to a petrified person. She won't hear a word you're saying. Ron shifts uncomfortably.
ron: We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it? A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.
madam pomfrey: Very well then. But be quick about it. As she exits, the boys step to her bed. Absently, Ron picks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand. Eyes Lockhart's Get Well card.
ron: You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? (off Harry's look) Right. Forget I said it.
environment: . 123
environment: Harry studies Hermione's face.
harry: Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched there. 124 INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER) 124 Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.
harry: 'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' (looking up) Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
ron: But it kills by looking people in the eye. Why is it no one's dead? Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters HARRY
harry: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least... (in a rush) Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again... (CONTINUED)
environment: . 124
environment: HARRY (CONT'D) ... And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.
ron: And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
harry: The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... (scanning the page again) The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits!
ron: But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...
harry: Hermione answered that too. Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is "Pipes."
ron: (aghast) Pipes...? It's using the plumbing.
harry: Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.
ron: Moaning Myrtle! Harry nods. Just then, McGonagall's VOICE ECHOES throughout the castle, magically magnified.
environment: . (2) 124
environment: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (V.O.) All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor. Immediately. 125 INT. SECOND FLOOR - CORRIDOR - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 125 McGonagall stands before the desecrated wall, surrounded by the rest of the staff. Harry and Ron creep up the stairwell. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster. Into the Chamber itself. (as the teachers react) I'm afraid we shall have to send the students home. I'm afraid... this is the end of Hogwarts.
gilderoy lockhart: (bursting in cheerily) So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?
snape: Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
gilderoy lockhart: My m-moment?
snape: Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
gilderoy lockhart: D-did I? I don't recall... PROFESSOR McGONAGALL That settles it. We'll leave it to you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.
environment: . 125 GILDEROY LOCKHART
gilderoy lockhart: V-very well. I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL The rest of us should go and inform the students what has happened.
professor sprout: Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Ginny Weasley. Ron's knees give way. As Harry catches him, the staff scatters, revealing what is written on the wall Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. 126 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 126 Harry and a very upset Ron walk with desperate purpose.
ron: She knew something, Harry. She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That's why she was taken. I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood. There can't be any other reason.
harry: (pulling him away) C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...
ron: Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know -- Harry glances over, studies Ron's tortured eyes.
harry: We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.
environment: /114. 126
environment: Ron nods, smiles shakily, and looks away. As he does, Harry's face changes, looks troubled. Even he doesn't believe what he's just said.
environment: 128 INT. GILDEROY LOCKHART'S OFFICE - NIGHT 128 Harry and Ron DASH inside.
harry: Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead. Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves. Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.
harry: Are you going somewhere?
gilderoy lockhart: Um, well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go...
ron: What about my sister?
gilderoy lockhart: Well, as to that -- most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I --
ron: You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
gilderoy lockhart: I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description --
environment: 115. 128 HARRY
harry: You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
gilderoy lockhart: Books can be misleading.
harry: You wrote them!
gilderoy lockhart: My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all...
harry: You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!
gilderoy lockhart: Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.
ron: Is there anything you can do?
gilderoy lockhart: Yes, now that you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same. Lockhart lifts his wand, but Harry is quicker.
environment: 116. (2) 128 HARRY
harry: Expelliarmus! Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open trunks, his wand flying across the floor.
harry: Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.
environment: 130 INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT 130 Lockhart walks ahead of Harry and Ron, their wands pointed at him. Moaning Myrtle floats above the cistern.
moaning myrtle: Who's there? Oh... (smiles, flirty) Hello, Harry. What do you want?
harry: To ask you how you died.
moaning myrtle: (flattered) Oooooh, it was dreadful. It happened right here. In this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.
harry: Who was it, Myrtle?
moaning myrtle: I don't know! I was distraught! But they said something funny. A kind of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go away, and... I died.
harry: Just like that? How?
environment: 117. 130 MOANING MYRTLE
moaning myrtle: No idea. I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there... Myrtle points to the bank of sinks. Harry and Ron hurry over, examining the pipes below, the tile above, then... Harry sees it etched on one of the COPPER TAPS is a TINY SNAKE.
harry: This is it, Ron. This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
ron: Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue. Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.
harry: Open up. Ron shakes his head. Harry's spoken in his regular voice.
ron: English. Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensely that the snake almost looks alive. When, finally, he speaks, it is more like a HISS. Parseltongue. The circular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE is exposed.
gilderoy lockhart: Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well then. I'll just be going. There's no need for me...
harry: Oh, yes there is. You first. Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.
gilderoy lockhart: Now, boys. What good will it do?
ron: A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.
environment: 118. (2) 130
environment: Lockhart steps grimly to the dark, gaping hole. Ron gives him a shove and he topples headfirst and out of sight. They wait. Finally... GILDEROY LOCKHART (O.S.) It's really quite filthy down here.
harry: All right. Let's go.
moaning myrtle: Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
harry: Thanks, Myrtle. Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows. 131 INT. PIPE - NIGHT 131 Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the damp floor of a stone tunnel. 132 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 132 Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his robes. Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his wand.
harry: Lumos! The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.
harry: Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They look down a rat's skull. All around them, the ground is littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks, his voice is hollow with dread.
environment: 119. 132 RON
ron: What's that? Up ahead?
gilderoy lockhart: That looks like a... snake. Terrified, Lockhart quickly HIDES HIS EYES.
harry: Maybe it's asleep. Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY SKIN.
ron: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more. THUD! They turn. Lockhart has passed out.
ron: Heart of a lion, this one. Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and, quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to his feet.
gilderoy lockhart: The adventure ends here, boys! But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. I'll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin. Say goodbye to your memories. (raising Ron's wand) Obliviate! Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhart OFF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into the rock above. As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harry the other. Harry sits up, squints through the settling dust. A SOLID WALL of BROKEN ROCK seals the tunnel between him and Ron. INTERCUT Harry and Ron.
harry: Ron? Are you okay?
environment: . (2) 132 RON
ron: I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. Lockhart sits up, dazed. Ron picks up a rock and CONKS him on the head. Lockhart PASSES OUT. Ron calls to Harry.
ron: What now?
harry: Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not back in an hour... He leaves it there.
ron: I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry --
harry: See you in a bit. Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off. He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.
harry: (Parseltongue) Open. The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN. Harry removes his wand and ENTERS. 133 INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133 A vast chamber stretches ahead. Along the path are rows of STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of black water. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN. Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies motionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms, her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble. A pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest. Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on the floor and kneels beside her. (BOLD ITALICS INDICATE POSSIBLE FLASHBACKS.)
harry: Ginny! Please don't be dead. Wake up! Wake up! Ginny!
environment: . 133 TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: She won't wake. Harry spins. Tom Riddle stands nearby. He is strangely BLURRED around the edges, as though Harry was looking at him through a misted window.
harry: Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...
tom riddle: She's still alive. But only just.
harry: Are you a ghost?
tom riddle: A memory. Preserved in a diary for fifty years. Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his own hand on Ginny's arm.
harry: She's cold as ice. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk --
tom riddle: It won't come until it's called. Harry looks up, sees Riddle twirling a wand in his fingers.
harry: Give me my wand, Tom.
tom riddle: You won't be needing it.
harry: Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!
tom riddle: I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger.
harry: But she's dying!
environment: . (2) 133 TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: Yes. I'm afraid so. But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny. She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes. Ginny poured her soul out to me. I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her... Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins cruelly.
tom riddle: Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
harry: No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.
tom riddle: It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat. Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.
harry: But... Why?...
tom riddle: Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. But then, who should find it... but you. The very person I was most anxious to meet.
harry: (getting angry) And why did you want to meet me?
environment: . (3) 133 TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: Ginny told me all about you. I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.
harry: Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?
tom riddle: It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.
harry: I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
tom riddle: I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
harry: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
tom riddle: Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been... you. (grinning) Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you.
harry: Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?
environment: . (4) 133 TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: She was afraid. Afraid you'd learn how to work the diary. Afraid I'd tell you just who it was that had been strangling all those roosters. Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE, then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.
tom riddle: Come now, Harry. Don't look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me. And we couldn't be having this little talk. And I have so many questions for you.
harry: Like what?
tom riddle: Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
harry: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
tom riddle: Voldemort is my past, present and future. Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to trace it through the air, writing three words "TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them "I AM LORD VOLDEMORT."
harry: You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?
tom riddle: Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name? (CONTINUED)
environment: . (5) 133
environment: TOM RIDDLE (CONT'D) No, I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
harry: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
tom riddle: Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
harry: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE in its golden talons.
harry: Fawkes. Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.
tom riddle: (giggling) This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Riddle tosses aside the hat. He turns to the statue of Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.
tom riddle: (Parseltongue) Speak to me, Slytherin. Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS. There is a RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING. Harry turns away. The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills out, uncoiling heavily to the floor. Harry turns to the wall. The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall. PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.
environment: . (6) 133 TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter, shall we? Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.
tom riddle: (Parseltongue) Kill him! The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward. Harry turns, RUNS away.
tom riddle: Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me.
harry: (to himself) Don't look. Don't look into its eyes. Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES. Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike. Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife, driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering eyes. As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall, the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away, its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.
tom riddle: Fool! Think you're safe! It can still hear you! As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE. Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE TUNNEL. 133A INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT 133A Harry RACES HEADLONG into the shadows, then looks back, sees the snake eclipse the light at the far end of the tunnel and SLITHER QUICKLY inside.
environment: A. 133A
environment: Thinking, Harry DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE, puts his hand over his mouth and waits, desperate to remain STILL and SILENT. The snake slides heavily by, then... SLOWS. TURNS BACK. The snake's head weaves inside, only INCHES from Harry's face. Harry trembles as the snake's head cocks to the side, then... finally... WITHDRAWS. 133B INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133B Harry DASHES back into the main chamber. Ginny looks frighteningly pale. Riddle GRINS cruelly, almost SOLID now.
environment: . 133B TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead. And I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return. Very much... alive. Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then -- impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what glitters within the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD. Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee, Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS BARED... STRIKES. Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor, watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes STILL. Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.
tom riddle: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body? If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now. I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm turns a troubling gray.
environment: A. (1A) 133B TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets. Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white now, a small ghost, the only evidence of life the TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER. Harry studies the finger and what lies beneath it Tom Riddle's diary. Harry begins to crawl toward her.
environment: . (2) 133B TOM RIDDLE
tom riddle: Funny, isn't it? The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the hands of a silly little girl. As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers, then... slips the diary free.
tom riddle: What are you doing? No. Stop... Riddle's face creases in fear. He LUNGES FORWARD. But Harry is too quick. Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES THE FANG into the book. Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from the pages.
tom riddle: No! Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to wither instantly, growing BLURRY once more. As the ink runs off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHES altogether. Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAINT MOAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As she sees Harry, she SOBS.
ginny: Harry. It was me! But I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. He wrote to me... took me over... I didn't even know whose diary it was. I found it inside my cauldron. The day we all went to Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're hurt...
harry: Ginny. You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron... There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays his head onto Harry's arm.
harry: You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough. Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almost instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself.
environment: 129. (3) 133B HARRY
harry: Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. (looking up at Ginny) It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory... 134 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER) 134 With Fawkes gliding gracefully ahead of them, Harry and Ginny make their way back. Up ahead, SHIFTING ROCK can be heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS. Ron's face appears.
ron: Ginny! Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.
ron: You're alive. I can't believe it.
ginny: I'm going to be expelled, I just know it!
ron: (to Harry) Remind you of anyone?
harry: Where's Lockhart? Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMING placidly.
ron: His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is. I keep having to stop him wandering off. He's a danger to himself.
gilderoy lockhart: Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?
ron: No. Ron turns, raises his eyebrows at Harry. Harry looks upward. There is an opening, hundreds of feet up. Just then, Fawkes circles back, fluttering in front of Harry.
environment: . 134 RON
ron: What's with the bird?
harry: I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here. 134A INT. ROCKY TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER) 134A A CURIOUS, GLIDING SHADOW RIPPLES across the cavernous wall, and then Harry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart soar out of the darkness, linked hand in hand. Fawkes is flying them home.
gilderoy lockhart: Amazing! This is just like magic!
environment: 135 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY 135 Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand in Dumbledore's office. Fawkes perches on a pedestal behind Dumbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charred diary. He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.
albus dumbledore: Ingenious. Simply... ingenious. (looking up) Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught him myself fifty years ago. After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped. When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been.
ginny: I didn't know whose diary it was, sir. I swear. I found it inside my cauldron. (to the others) The day we all went to Diagon Alley.
environment: . 135
environment: Hearing this, Harry frowns in thought, recollecting...
ginny: But I understand if... given all the trouble I've caused... if you --
albus dumbledore: Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Certainly, Albus. As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs. Weasley's VOICE carries
mrs. weasley: A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny! What were you thinking? Haven't I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain! Harry and Ron turn back. See Dumbledore regarding them gravely.
albus dumbledore: You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?
harry: Yes, sir.
ron: Yes, sir.
albus dumbledore: And that there is sufficient evidence to expel you both?
harry: Yes, sir.
ron: Yes, sir.
environment: A. (1A) 135 DUMBLEDORE
albus dumbledore: Therefore, it seems only fitting... (eyes twinkling) That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor the House Cup.
environment: . (2) 135 HARRY/RON
harry: (grinning) Thank you, sir.
ron: (grinning) Thank you, sir.
albus dumbledore: Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. We need our gamekeeper back. Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.
albus dumbledore: First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?
harry: It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.
environment: . (3) 135 DUMBLEDORE
albus dumbledore: You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
harry: Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?
albus dumbledore: Not intentionally, but... yes.
harry: So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.
albus dumbledore: It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.
harry: Only because I asked it to.
albus dumbledore: Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices. (smiling at him) If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this. Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. An ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.
harry: 'Godric Gryffindor.'
albus dumbledore: Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat. . (4) 135
environment: Suddenly, Lucius Malfoy enters, dragging... Dobby by the ear.
harry: Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys! Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.
lucius malfoy: Out of my way, Potter. (to Dumbledore) So! You've returned!
albus dumbledore: Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. (a wry smile) Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.
lucius malfoy: From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.
albus dumbledore: Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only this time, he chose to act through someone else. By means of... this. As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy, Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to Lucius.
albus dumbledore: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. (a chill to his voice) One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe.
environment: . (5) 135
environment: Lucius Malfoy stares icily at Dumbledore, then turns away.
lucius malfoy: Come, Dobby. We're leaving. As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICKS HIM through it, then exits himself. Harry stares at the empty doorway as DOBBY'S PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from the corridor.
harry: Sir? I wonder if I could have that. Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary. 135A EXT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 135A As the elevator opens, Harry dashes out.
harry: Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's hand.
lucius malfoy: Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
harry: I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS
lucius malfoy: Prove it! He turns away. As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching the diary in his hand, Harry mouths the words Open it. Dobby looks down curiously. Inside... is a SOCK. He GASPS.
lucius malfoy: Dobby! Dobby, come!
environment: . 135A DOBBY
dobby: (in wonderment) Master has given Dobby a sock. Master has presented Dobby with clothes. Dobby is... free!
lucius malfoy: What? I didn't -- He wheels, sees Harry standing with one leg crossed His right ankle is bare. Instantly, Malfoy charges forth.
lucius malfoy: You've lost me my servant!
dobby: You shall not harm Harry Potter! Dobby steps between and -- BANG! Malfoy flies backwards, lands in a crumpled heap. Rising, he stares murderously at Harry.
lucius malfoy: Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too. With that, he turns, storms off.
dobby: Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
harry: Just promise me something.
dobby: Anything, sir.
harry: Never try to save my life again. Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone.
environment: 137 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 137 Fear and suspicion banished, the House tables abuzz with excitement and anticipation... all except the Slytherins, who do not share the general feeling.
environment: . 137
environment: Seated at the tables, are the formerly petrified, revived students. Justin Finch-Fletchley joins his fellow Hufflepuffs. Colin Creevey SNAPS photos of the proceedings. At the rear of the hall, standing near the entrance, Filch is reunited with Mrs. Norris. Then... Hermione enters, searching the room for Harry and Ron. Finally, she sees them. Smiles. Runs forward and embraces Harry.
hermione: You solved it! You solved it!
harry: With loads of help from you. She turns to embrace Ron. They pause, an awkward moment between them and... shake hands instead.
ron: Welcome back, Hermione. McGonagall taps her goblet. Dumbledore stands.
albus dumbledore: Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified. Everyone applauds.
albus dumbledore: Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.
hermione: Oh, no! At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's Hagrid. He enters. Stops. Looks around. The room falls SILENT. All eyes upon him. He glances around. Nervous. Embarrassed.
hagrid: Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n confused. Some ruddy bird named Errol.
environment: . (2) 137
environment: Ron exchanges a nervous glance with Dumbledore. Hagrid looks at all of the faces staring at him. He turns to Harry.
hagrid: I jus' want to say... that if it wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an' Ron... and Hermione... Well, I jus' want to say... Thanks.
harry: There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly... brings his hands together. The others join him. Soon, everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING. As the students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes, and... CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the celebration. WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the night. FADE TO BLACK.
full tan draft: february 24, 2003
environment: a tent of blankets. within... the shadow of a boy. a
harry: lumos maxima... the tent blooms softly with light -- briefly illuminating a bedside photograph (of james &amp; lily potter) -- then goes dark.
harry: lumos maxima... as the blankets blaze, we cut inside, find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: harry potter. open before him is violeta stitch's extreme incantations. once again, he speaks:
environment: a blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of number four. dogs bark. and a title card appears:
environment: the light in the hallway snaps on, harry's tent droops once more and, seconds later, harry's door eases open. uncle vernon peers in and switches on the light. the room is utterly silent. slowly, he closes the door.
environment: harry! harry! harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall, where his aunt petunia and cousin dudley stand stiffly. petunia flicks a bit of fluff from dudley's sweater, glowers crossly at harry, and jerks her head toward the door.
aunt petunia: marge! welcome! how was the train?
aunt petunia: ah. how... unfortunate.
harry: uncle vernon. i need you to sign this form.
harry: nothing. something for school... uncle vernon eyes the parchment in harry's hand suspiciously.
harry: i will if she does.
harry: yes.
aunt marge: is that my dudders! hm? is that my neffy poo? come and say hello to your auntie marge. marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes. dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. harry looks on, then sees ripper snuffling about his ankle.
uncle vernon: can i tempt you, marge?
aunt marge: what are you smirking at! where is it that you send him, vernon?
aunt marge: i see. and do they use the cane at st. brutus's, boy?
aunt marge: excellent. i won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. (another sip) still. mustn't blame yourself for how this one's turned out, vernon. it all comes down to blood. bad blood will out. what is it the boy's father did, petunia?
aunt marge: of course. and a drunk, i expect --
aunt marge: what did you say?
aunt petunia: oh my goodness! marge!
uncle vernon: you go to bed. now.
harry: shut up! shut up! aunt marge starts to reply, when -- zing! -- a button on her dress sails into the air. seams groan. thread snaps. aunt marge's eyes widen. her cheeks billow. her whole body billows. and she begins to inflate like a
environment: the others race outside. as aunt marge begins to float away, uncle vernon grips her hands.
aunt marge: vernon. don't you dare -- but he does. he lets go. falls to his knees. and watches aunt marge float away.
environment: boom! boom! boom! harry tows the trunk down the stairs... finds uncle vernon waiting for him.
harry: no! she deserved what she got! and you... you keep away from me. uncle vernon eyes harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty.
harry: anywhere's better than here.
environment: harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. glances about. an empty playground. swings creaking gently on rusted chains. a tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. harry drops the trunk. sits. deep in the night, an alarm shrieks, goes silent. harry, still as a statue. listening. in the trees above, leaves tremble. the wind gathers. harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel. then, he... stiffens. turns back. sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises. slowly draws his wand. then he sees... it. something big. darker than the shadows which conceal it. something with wide, gleaming
harry: aaaah! giant wheels bear down. harry rolls clear -- just as a preposterously purple, triple-decker bus screeches to a halt. gold letters glimmer above the windscreen: the knight bus. doors hiss. snap back. reveal stan shunpike, an 18- year-old boy in a wrinkled conductor's uniform. pasty face. raccoon eyes. stan looks like he hasn't seen the sun in years.
harry: fell over.
harry: i didn't do it on purpose. stan eyes harry suspiciously, nods slowly.
environment: no seats. only beds. the brass frames need a shine, the lines a wash. in one bed, a disheveled wizard grunts, turns over in his sleep.
stan shunpike: take 'er away, ern.
stan shunpike: wot you say your name was again?
stan shunpike: whereabouts you headin'? harry hesitates. he hadn't thought about this. decides.
stan shunpike: is it now? get that, ern? the leaky cauldron. that's in london. stan grins with sinister delight, showing bad teeth.
harry: isn't this a bit... dangerous?
shrunken head: heads up! little old lady at twelve o'clock! sure enough, directly ahead, a little old lady is crossing the street. ernie hits the brakes hard and harry flies forward, palms to the window. the brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and harry flies back onto his bed. bang! the bus rockets forward once more. as harry rights himself, he notices the headline of stan's daily prophet: escape from azkaban! below, a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair glowers from a
harry: who is that? that man.
stan shunpike: a murderer, he is. got 'imself locked up in azkaban for it.
stan shunpike: tha's the question, isn't it? he's the firs' that's done it. gives me the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, i'll tell you that. big supporter of you- know-'oo, black was. reckon you heard o' him. harry nods and, as he does, black's eyes shift. meet harry's.
shrunken head: hate that.
stan shunpike: them! don' listen properly, do they? don' look properly either. never notice nuffink, they don'. just then, a couple walking a dog are engulfed by a rush of wind as the (invisible) knight bus whooshes past. the couple glances about in bewilderment. the dog yaps madly.
environment: the chandelier sways drunkenly as the bus doors open. the steps groan with heavy feet and a figure appears: tom, innkeeper of the leaky cauldron pub.
environment: as the knight bus rockets off, tom and harry are revealed, harry glances up, reads the sign above: the leaky cauldron. tom drags harry's trunk inside, then pauses and, with a flick of his wand, silences the car alarm.
environment: harry trails tom through the quiet room. the bartender glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. a solitary wizard reads a book while, at his elbow, his coffee cup stirs itself. tom leads harry upstairs.
harry: hedwig!
cornelius fudge: i should tell you, mr. potter, earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located just south of sheffield, circling a chimney stack. the accidental magic reversal department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified. she has no recollection of the incident whatsoever. harry waits. a man condemned. then fudge turns.
harry: no thank you. minister... i don't understand. i broke the law. underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --
harry: 'the state of things' sir?
harry: sirius black, you mean. but... what's that got to do with me? crack! tom shatters another walnut. fudge smiles nervously.
cornelius fudge: by the way, harry. whilst you're here it would be best if you didn't... wander.
environment: through the window: the rooftops of london. a train passes and camera pulls back, reveals harry, standing with hedwig. he turns, eyes his schoolbooks. he studies the growling tome -- the monster book of monsters -- then gives the rope a tug. instantly... ... the book leaps to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers snapping. harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins nipping viciously at his shoes. harry vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a
environment: a young witch in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall. harry exits his room as the witch knocks on a door.
young witch: (unperturbed) i'll come back later.
environment: something small and fast dashes by harry's feet. looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking rat (scabbers), pursued by a decidedly ugly orange cat (crookshanks).
environment: as harry moves down the stairs, voices come from below.
environment: he's a cat, ronald! what do you expect? it's in his nature. as harry reaches bottom, he finds ron weasley protectively cradling scabbers, while hermione grander does her best to restrain a hissing crookshanks.
hermione: that's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. (cooing to the cat) it's all right, crookshanks. you just ignore the mean little boy... then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.
a headline screams: "grand prize winner visits egypt!": in the accompanying photo, the entire weasley family stands before the great pyramids, waving. smack in the middle is ron, scabbers perched on his shoulder.
harry: egypt! what's it like?
hermione: you know, the ancient egyptians of the nile river delta worshipped the cat goddess bast. ron glares stonily at hermione, then turns back to harry.
george: not flashing that clipping about again, are you, ron?
fred: no, not a soul. unless you count tom. the day maid. the night maid. the cook. the bloke that came to fix the toilet. that wizard from belgium... mrs. weasley takes harry's face in her hands, smiles. as if relieved to see him.
harry: good to see you too, mrs. weasley.
harry: of course, mr. weasley. as mr. weasley pulls harry away, the others continue to hover over the clipping in the b.g.
ginny: that's your nose, fred.
arthur weasley: harry. there are some within the ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what i'm about to tell you. but i think you need to know the facts. because you're in danger. grave danger. harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.
arthur weasley: what do you know of sirius black, harry?
arthur weasley: harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped... mr. weasley hesitates, unable to continue.
arthur weasley: (nodding nervously) black lost everything. but he remains a loyal servant to this day. in his mind, only you stand in the way of... once again, mr. weasley hesitates.
arthur weasley: harry, i hate it when you say --
arthur weasley: in black's mind, only you stand in the way of... you-know-who returning to power. that's why he's broken. that's why he's broken out of azkaban. to find you. and... mr. weasley hesitates yet again.
arthur weasley: harry. i want you to swear that -- whatever you might hear -- you won't go looking for black.
arthur weasley: just watch yourself, will you, harry?
mrs. weasley: ron! she hands scabbers through the open window to him.
harry: i didn't mean to blow her up. i just... (troubled by the memory) ... lost control.
hermione: honestly, ron, it's not funny. harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.
harry: hi, neville. as he bumps past, hermione nods to a compartment.
hermione: hi, neville. as he bumps past, hermione nods to a compartment.
ron: hi, neville. as he bumps past, hermione nods to a compartment.
environment: as they slip inside, they find a man in shabby robes (professor lupin) slumped against the window, asleep. he looks ill, exhausted. the trio eye him warily. whisper.
hermione: professor r.j. lupin.
hermione: it's on his case. she points. stamped in peeling letters on a battered case is "professor r.j. lupin."
hermione: seems to be. why? what is it, harry?
environment: ron and hermione stare at harry, faces stricken in the lantern light that now glows in the compartment. crookshanks slumbers in his cage.
harry: yes.
ron: sure -- of course, no one's ever broken out of azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic... just then, the compartment rattles. lanterns flicker. the train lurches, begins to slow. hermione slides down the seat, pinning ron against the window. they exchange an awkward glance, then hermione carefully slides to the other end of the seat and glances at her watch. frowns.
environment: ... die. one by one. until all is...
ron: what's going on?
environment: a thin wisp of steam escapes ron's mouth. harry notices.
hermione: ouch! ron, that was my foot! squeak-squeak-squeak. ron, a dark silhouette against the window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.
ron: bloody hell. what's happening? ssssst! a soft crackling fills the car and flames bloom... in the hands of r.j. lupin. in the shivering light, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert. wary.
hermione: harry? harry, are you all right? hermione's troubled face hovers above him. he nods. sits up. ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand. harry's glasses.
professor lupin: chocolate. eat. it'll help.
professor lupin: a dementor. one of the guards of azkaban. it's gone now. harry frowns in confusion.
professor lupin: i need to have a word with the driver. excuse me. (the chocolate) eat. it'll help. as he leaves, harry turns to ron and hermione.
ron: well, you sort of went... rigid. we thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
ron: no. i felt... weird. like i'd never be cheerful again. but... no. harry turns to hermione. she shakes her head.
harry: but someone was screaming. a woman. hermione and ron glance nervously at each other.
dumbledore: welcome! welcome to another year at hogwarts! i have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. i myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair... mcgonagall clears her throat.
dumbledore: as some of you may know, professor kettleburn, our care of magical creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. fortunately, i'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own rubeus hagrid!
environment: harry, ron, and hermione stare at each other -- stunned -- then applaud vigorously. hagrid turns ruby red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending water goblets weaving.
dumbledore: the dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. while they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities. under no circumstances are you to approach them. it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
environment: harry, ron and hermione arrive at the seventh floor landing and approach the fat lady in the portrait.
environment: the gryffindors trail through the common room, the girls heading one way, boys the other.
ron: good to be home, eh, harry? harry turns -- caught -- and finds ron studying him from his own bed, scabbers cradled in his hand. harry nods and turns to the window..
environment: harry continues to stare.
environment: as bridge and castle glimmer in the distance, hagrid emerges from the forbidden forest, dragging a fistful of dead ferrets by the tail. a bird appears, circles his head playfully, chirp-chirp-chirping merrily before it... ... flutters off, pin-wheeling past flowers, into a birdbath, finally coming to rest upon... ... an ancient tree. it twitters cheerfully, singing its lovely song, when -- thwock! -- a branch punts the bird into the air. as feathers fly, the whomping willow resumes its shape.
environment: harry, ron and hermione sit on fat little pouffes in a murky, incense-laden room, along with neville, dean, seamus, lavender brown, parvati patil and others.
professor trelawney: ... the sight. hello. i am professor trelawney. together, we shall cast ourselves into the future. but know this. one either has the gift or not. it cannot be divined from the pages of a book. books only cloud one's inner eye.
ron: where'd you come from?
professor trelawney: (spinning on neville) you, boy! is your grandmother well?
professor trelawney: i wouldn't be so sure of that. (continuing) the first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves. if all goes well, we will proceed to palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. (eyeing parvati) by the way, dear, beware a red- haired man.
environment: parvati eyes ron dubiously. edges her pouffe away.
professor trelawney: well then. shall we?
teacup - detail - later: inside, a cloud of tea leaves mutates oddly. harry, sitting opposite ron now, frowns at the leaves, consults the symbols in the textbook (unfogging the future) at his elbow. trelawney walks amongst them, robes flowing.
professor trelawney: a five-leaf clover... you can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear. (then, casually) mr. longbottom, after you've broken your first cup... ca-chink! neville fumbles the cup in his hands and the brittle crash of china is heard.
ron: well. he's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. but this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. so... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it. professor trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and
professor trelawney: ahhh!
professor trelawney: my dear boy... you have the grim.
parvati: the grim. not the grin, you idiot.
lavender: 'the grim...' all turn, see lavender bent over her textbook.
environment: the trio emerge from the bridge and make their way toward hagrid's hut. the whomping willow looms in the distance.
ron: ancient runes? exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
ron: hang on. ancient runes is the same time as divination. you'd have to be in two classes at once.
environment: students gather around hagrid as harry, ron and hermione arrive. draco, crabbe, and goyle stand with the slytherins.
environment: hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side of the forbidden forest. in the paddock, a freestanding iron rack hangs with dead ferrets, buzzing with flies. nearby is a pumpkin patch.
draco: and exactly how do we do that?
environment: hagrid looks. belts, rope, spellotape: any means available have been employed to bridle the monster book of monsters, which quiver violently.
hagrid: righ' then. so... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the magical creatures. right. so... i'll... i'll go an' get 'em. hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. draco shakes his head, speaks loudly to crabbe and goyle.
harry: listen, you stupid prat -- eyes widening in fear, malfoy steps back, points.
hagrid: gee up, there! (grinning) beau'iful, isn' he?
environment: there seems no consensus on this, but the students stare in wary wonder nonetheless. as hagrid coaxes the beast to the center of the paddock, ron stares uneasily.
hagrid: a hippogriff, o' course. now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud. easily offended, hippogriffs are. don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh do. right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello? the entire class steps back, leaving harry in front.
hagrid: tha's it. easy now... stop! this here's buckbeak, harry. yeh want ter let 'im make the firs' move. it's polite, see? jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. ready? unsure, harry nods anyway. steps forward. and... bows. buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying harry cannily. harry waits. and waits...
hagrid: well done, harry! go on. give 'im a pat. tentatively, harry reaches out, lays his hand on buckbeak's fierce beak. the class claps. harry smiles.
harry: (smile drooping) excuse me?
hagrid: off yeh go! as buckbeak gallops forward, harry slides scarily back, giant wings unfold, huge and powerful, and -- whoosh! -- they soar into the air. rising higher. and higher. and higher. gradually, harry loosens his hold on buckbeak's neck. losing himself in the joy of flying. smiling at the sight of his and buckbeak's shadow racing across the grass below. circling over the whomping willow, past hogwarts castle, and then swooping, with heart-stopping speed, over the black lake, buckbeak's talons tickling the smooth glass of the water, summoning the giant squid to the surface briefly. hagrid whistles then, and buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock, galloping to a halt. as harry slides off, the class cheers -- all except draco, who narrows his eyes maliciously.
harry: brilliant... professor. they both grin, when draco pushes past them roughly, strides toward buckbeak.
hagrid: malfoy! no! in a flash, buckbeak's steely talons slash down. malfoy freezes. looks down at the blood blossoming on his robes. shrieks. instantly, harry dashes forward. buckbeak whips around, raises its talons and -- seeing harry -- lowers them. ducks its beak. harry... realizing what he's done... breathes.
hagrid: calm yerself! yer fine... jus' a scratch... hagrid looks: a deep gash glistens on draco's limp arm.
hagrid: no. i'm the teacher. you all... you all just... class dismissed! and with that, hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the castle.
pansy: does it hurt terribly, draco?
ron: the little git. he's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
hermione: yes. but i hear draco's father's furious. i don't think we've heard the end of this...
ron: who? but the photograph on the prophet's front page provides a chilling answer: sirius black. hermione reads over the shoulders of others. whispers half to herself:
neville: you don't think he'd come to hogwarts, do you?
lavendar: dementors? he's already slipped by them once, hasn't he? who's to say he can't do it again?
environment: as a flicker of fear passes through harry's face, bem, a nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of black.
environment: beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then, slowly begin to wither. the dew freezes, the grass grows brittle. seconds later, the dementors sweep by.
professor lupin: intriguing, yes? would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's inside?
professor lupin: very good, mr. finnigan. can anyone tell us what a boggart looks like?
ron: when'd she get here?
professor lupin: terrifying, yes. luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. let's practice it now, shall we? without wands, please... riddikulus!
draco: (muttering softly) it's this class that's ridiculous.
professor lupin: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most?
professor lupin: didn't catch that, neville, sorry.
professor lupin: hmmm... yes. neville, i believe you live with your grandmother?
professor lupin: it won't. but i want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very clearly in your mind. can you do that?
professor lupin: that's fine. we don't need to hear it. if you see it, we will. now, when i open this wardrobe, neville, here's what i want you to do... lupin leans close to neville, whispers. neville's eyes pop open in shock. consider lupin uncertainly.
professor lupin: right then. wand at the ready. one. two. three! sparks jet from lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe bursts open. instantly, snape appears, eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. neville backs away in fright.
neville: r-r-riddikulus! crack! snape stumbles in a flash of light and reappears... in a long, lace-trimmed dress, towering moth-eaten hat, and crimson handbag. instantly, the class roars (except for draco and his fellow slytherins). neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself. lupin drops the needle on an old gramaphone. as a scratchy rhumba fills the room, he points to ron.
ron: riddikulus! crack! roller skates materialize on the spider's hairy feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place. instantly, ron relaxes as the class' laughter rings out.
parvati: riddikulus! as the vampire whips its cloak across its eyes, we cut behind... so our pov is of the students. swish! the cloak reopens, the class laughs, and we reverse again... see that the vampire is now dressed like carmen miranda. as it begins to shimmy about -- against its will -- the class starts to clap.
dean thomas: riddikulus! the cobra's hooded head bobs back and forth, transforms into a jack-in-the-box. lupin grins and...
professor lupin: here! crack! -- the dementor vanishes and a roiling mist appears, which becomes clouds. something glows within the clouds, white, silvery and round...
professor lupin: well done, everyone. i think that's enough excitement for today. as the students exit, chattering loudly, only harry, subdued, remains behind. at the doorway, lupin glances back, exchanges a private glance with him. as he exits, the wardrobe gives one last rattle.
harry: yes, professor, but i thought if you said i could go -- professor mcgonagall but i don't say so. a parent or guardian must sign, and since i am neither, it would be inappropriate. (a flicker of pity) i'm sorry, potter. but that's my final word. ron and hermione -- watching harry expectantly from across the way -- see him turn, shake his head. their faces fall. harry raises his hand in farewell. watches them go.
environment: thru thru
professor lupin: well, don't feel too bad. i was roundly disappointed the first time i went.
professor lupin: no. i was just trying to make you feel better. honeydukes' sweets are the best in the world. their pepper imps are so strong you smoke at the ears. and zonko's joke shop may be dangerous, but you can't beat their stink pellets.
professor lupin: yes, that too...
professor lupin: you'd like to know why i stopped you from facing the boggart. (off harry's surprise) i should think it'd be obvious. i assumed the boggart would take the shape of lord voldemort. harry frowns. lupin studies him curiously.
harry: i did think of voldemort first. but then, i remembered that night on the train... and the dementors...
professor lupin: well, well. i'm impressed. that suggests that what you fear most of all is... fear. very wise.
professor lupin: dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives. our pain becomes their power.
professor lupin: the first time i saw you, harry, i recognized you immediately. not by your scar. by your eyes. they're your mother lily's. (nodding) yes. i knew her. she was there for me at a time when no one else was. we used to talk for hours. she was not only a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman. she had a way of seeing the beauty in whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in themselves... lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.
professor lupin: i could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents, harry -- but know this... (eyeing harry intensely) they lived. every moment of every day. you should know that. that's how they'd want to be remembered.
hermione: and the post office! it's about 200 owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves, depending on how fast you want your letter to go!
hermione: but, i mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. don't you think, ron?
ron: if there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin. mind you, fred and george say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but i thought, you know, it can't hurt, given that...
harry: i'm glad you had a good time. really. and thanks for this. (eyeing the sneakoscope) rubbish or not, you're right. it can't hurt. with that, harry pops a pepper imp into his mouth.
ron: never mind.
environment: as harry, ron, and hermione climb the stairs, they find a crowd gathering on the seventh floor landing.
percy: (pushing past) let me through, please. excuse me, thank you, i'm head boy... (stopping dead) back! all of you! no one is to enter this dormitory until it has been fully searched! harry, ron, and hermione exchange dark glances, when... ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.
ron: probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor again.
dumbledore: mr. filch. round up the ghosts. tell them to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady.
environment: just then, there is a scream. the students dash to the landing, where all the paintings whisper fearfully. filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows, then... narrow.
dumbledore: dear lady. who did this to you?
dumbledore: secure the castle, mr. filch. the rest of you... to the great hall.
environment: camera drifts through the silent room, over an ocean of sleeping bags, finds harry lying awake, staring at the net of stars glimmering beyond the highest window.
environment: a gentle creak is heard and harry's eyes shift, see snape pass through the great doors, converge with dumbledore.
dumbledore: (nodding) i didn't really expect him to linger.
snape: you may recall, prior to the start of term, i did express my concerns when you appointed professor --
dumbledore: no... i feel quite confident the castle is safe. and i'm more than willing to let the students return to their houses. but tomorrow. for now, let them sleep... as dumbledore's gaze finds harry, he shuts his eyes, feigns sleep.
environment: the whomping willow idly casts off a few withering leaves.
environment: the fat lady has been replaced by a painting of a tiny knight (sir cadogan). stalking a bare stretch of grass as his pony grazes nearby, he brandishes his sword wildly as a group of gryffindors regard him warily.
seamus: he's barking mad!
neville: but he keeps changing the password. twice just this morning! i've taken to keeping a list. as neville holds up a wrinkled piece of parchment, harry, ron and hermione begin to exit.
ron: yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental.
environment: snap! snape pulls down a screen over the blackboard, turns.
harry: excuse me, sir, but... where's professor lupin?
ron: werewolves?
snape: quiet!
snape: now. which of you can tell me the difference between an animagus and a werewolf? as the class stares mutely at a slide of an attacking werewolf, hermione waiting desperately for someone to respond to snape's question, the moth flutters by harry.
environment: swat! he pins it to his desk. a tiny cloud of moth dust mushrooms into the air and harry lifts his palm. malfoy's parchment has reappeared.
hermione: please, sir, an animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. a werewolf has no choice in the matter. furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind -- malfoy lets out a low howl.
ron: (to harry) he's got a point, you know. harry stares at the parchment. malfoy has drawn a crude caricature of harry in his quidditch robes being struck by lightning over and over.
snape: not exactly picasso, are you? i hope you demonstrate more talent on the quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist.
environment: if not, i fear you'll perish, given the weather forecast. until that time, however, you'll forgive me if i don't let you off homework. should you die, i assure you... you need not hand it in. as snape turns away, malfoy sniggers with crabbe, coyle and pike. harry glances down at the drawing once more and we hear a true rumble of thunder and --
intercut harry's pov: -- as he flies, rain falling like needles before him, every dark cloud concealing potential danger. beaters crisscross his path. a bludger whizzes past, then a second rockets directly at him. swoop! -- harry ducks, watches the bludger shatter the broom of a hufflepuff beater. the beater goes into a wild spiral, vanishes in the mist.
harry: faster! come on! the trace of a smile forms on harry's lips as he closes on the snitch... only yards away... reaching out... when...
environment: ... a thin glaze of ice clouds his glasses. he wipes at them, then flinches: blood trickles down his cheek. the rain is turning to needles. needles of ice. harry glances at the handle of his broomstick. the water sluicing through the grain is freezing. vapor streams from his mouth and nose. swoosh! a dark silhouette passes on his right. he turns. swoosh! -- a twin silhouette passes on his left. harry sees neither. looks down. the layers of mist are parting below. lightning strikes. reveals: an army of silhouettes drifting onto the pitch. a vast legion of them...
hermione: no!!! harry and broom tumble in opposite directions. the nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents, then drops... right into the whomping willow. floomph! harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud, then another. plummeting through the circling dementors. then... a tall figure rises from the crowd. raises an open hand to the heavens. eyes angry but clear. dumbledore. an explosion -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the air. a flash -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky. and then...
ron: looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
george: yeah, c'mon, ron. we'll walk you off the astronomy tower and see how you come out looking.
hermione: harry! how're you feeling?
harry: brilliant.
harry: what happened?
harry: really? i meant the match. who won? silence. uncomfortable glances.
ron: there's something else you should know, harry. your nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed in the whomping willow. and well... he tips a bag of splintered wood and twisted twigs onto the bed. as harry stares, we hear a gentle wind, then...
environment: harry shakes his head in response to lupin's question, then -- whoosh! -- sets hedwig free of her traces. as she soars into the sky, harry and lupin watch from the lake's edge.
professor lupin: dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. they feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with nothing but his worst experiences. you're not weak, harry. the dementors affect you most, because there are true horrors in your past. horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. you have nothing to be ashamed of.
professor lupin: i'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
professor lupin: there was only one that night...
professor lupin: (a beat) i don't pretend to be an expert, harry. but yes, i can teach you. perhaps after the holiday. for now, though, i need to rest. i'm feeling... tired. harry turns, studies lupin's haggard face. a weary smile appears as hedwig's reflection glides over lupin's irises.
environment: ... to hogwarts castle, weeks later, dusted in white.
harry's pov: a ragged line of students follows mcgonagall toward the bridge. harry's pov becomes objective and...
fred: clever, harry.
fred: besides, we've got a better way.
harry: what's this rubbish?
george: it's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.
george: i solemnly swear that i am up to no good. george touches his wand to the parchment and intricate ink lines surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like veins. harry reads the curious words at the top:
george: ah... moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs. we owe them so much.
fred: dumbledore.
fred: pacing.
harry: you mean, this map shows...
harry: everyone?
fred: where they are.
fred: every minute.
harry: brilliant! where'd you get it?
fred: this one.
george: this one.
harry: the one-eyed...
environment: harry approaches a statue of a hump-backed, one-eyed
harry: dissendium? click! the witch's eye opens and the statue pivots, revealing a dark opening in the floor. as harry crouches, squinting, a cool draft of air ruffles his hair and the camera drifts into the darkness...
environment: harry stops, cranes his neck. stone steps. taps the map.
environment: a box of jelly slugs as well, horace. we're nearly cleared out. horace grunts, begins moving boxes. harry looks up to the cellar door, takes out the invisibility cloak...
environment: at this elevation, the mist hangs in thick, undulating veils, the shrieking shack an eerie silhouette in the gloom. ron and hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically, they're scared stiff.
ron: twice.
ron: huh? oh... all right...
environment: they take a step. one step. stop dead.
hermione: perfect. just then, voices echo and three figures appear over the rise, phantoms in the mist. malfoy. crabbe. goyle. pike.
ron: shut your mouth, malfoy.
hermione: (a harsh chuckle) hope you don't mean yourself. malfoy's eyes shift, regard hermione with disgust.
draco: who did that! malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- splat! splat! -- he takes two more. hermione and ron glance about uneasily.
draco: wait a minute, there's something out here -- aaaaaaahhhh!!! malfoy's ski mask is pulled over his eyes, he's spun about, given a rough kick to the ass and sent stumbling over the rise and out of sight. instantly, crabbe and goyle join him. ron and hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance, and... dash off... when -- flumph! -- they both go flying, land on their pants in the snow. as they sit up, they hear... laughter. hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion.
ron: that was not bloody hell, harry! funny! but he's smiling. they all are. as he and hermione pelt harry with snowballs, we --
ron: those weasels! never told me about any marauder's map!
ron: oh sure. along with his invisibility cloak, his pack of exploding snap cards, his --
environment: rosmerta, m'dear! up ahead cornelius fudge emerges from a ministry sleigh as hagrid swings the door clear and -- with unfortunate ease -- rips it clean off the fittings. fudge joins mcgonagall and a curvy barmaid (rosmerta) outside the
hermione: that's madam rosmerta. ron fancies her.
harry: shhh.
madam rosmerta: it'd be a right sight better if the ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night.
madam rosmerta: sirius black? in hogsmeade! and what would bring him here?
madam rosmerta: harry potter!
environment: fudge looks around nervously, then jerks his head toward the pub. as he leads rosmerta and mcgonagall inside, we --
environment: so i says to him, 'careful, ned. don't want to go losing your head!' as the three heads cackle hysterically, bobbing up and down on their strings, harry turns... just as an unshaven wizard's arm whips down and a dart goes whistling right toward harry's eyes. harry ducks, pivots, and -- thwock! -- sees the dart pierce the cork of the disfigured dartboard behind him. harry hurries on, trailing fudge and mcgonagall up a dark stairwell as rosmerta leads them into a small back room. as the door starts to close, harry rushes forward: slam! too late. camera tilts. the knob turns, the door opens...
madam rosmerta: come on then. let's hear it.
environment: professor mcgonagall years ago, when harry potter's parents were marked for death, they went into hiding. few knew where they were. one who did was black. and he told...
cornelius fudge: ha! tell that to peter pettigrew!
madam rosmerta: i remember him. what's he got to do with it? professor mcgonagall after the potters were killed, pettigrew went looking for black. and, unfortunately... found him.
madam rosmerta: harry.
environment: mcgonagall nods, then looks pained.
madam rosmerta: what could be worse? professor mcgonagall this: sirius black was and remains today... harry potter's godfather. blam! the pub doors fly open, reveal main street, where ron and hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the chill. as they look down, camera tilts...
day: ... and footprints appear in the snow. harry's pov ends. camera tilts up, follows hermione and ron until they leave frame, then holds on a poster of black, fluttering against a lamppost: "have you seen this wizard?"
harry: he was their friend. and he betrayed them. he was their friend. (eyes hardening) i hope he finds me. but when he does, i'm going to be ready. when he does, i'm going to kill him.
environment: the dying sun streams through high windows, painting harry's face a fierce amber-red as he stands opposite lupin. ancient charts drape the walls while gleaming spheres of spun glass orbit one another silently. lupin paces before a large trunk.
harry: if black can fight the dementors, i need to know how too. lupin studies harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
professor lupin: a patronus is a kind of positive force. for the wizard who can conjure one, the patronus works something like a shield. the dementor feeds on it instead of him. just then, the trunk rattles violently. as harry's eyes wander, lupin snaps his fingers, brings his attention back.
professor lupin: got something? good. let it fill you up. lose yourself in it. then speak the incantation: expecto patronum. without your wand...
professor lupin: right then. shall we? harry nods, raises his wand. lupin, watching closely, reaches over, grips the lid of the trunk...
harry: expecto... patronum... the torches on the wall flicker as a chill breeze fills the chamber. a scream echoes distantly. harry's hand trembles. his eyes begin to roll up...
professor lupin: here! crack! -- the dementor mutates into a silvery white orb.
professor lupin: quickly. harry studies the frog. takes a bite. begins to recover.
professor lupin: boggart, harry. the real thing would be much, much worse. just out of interest, what were you thinking of? what memory did you choose?
professor lupin: that's not good enough, harry. not nearly. harry glances toward the window, at the bloody sun.
professor lupin: is it strong? harry looks up into lupin's eyes. emotional. nods.
professor lupin: think, harry, think --
harry: expecto patronum! harry's hand trembles. his whole body trembles. but he holds his ground, when -- whoosh! -- a huge silver shadow bursts from the end of his wand, hovering between him and the dementor. the dementor falters... harry's legs like water...
professor lupin: well done.
professor lupin: so you know, harry: you'd have given your father a run for his money. and, believe me, that's saying something. harry ponders this. then speaks, deep inside himself.
harry: but it's the best i have.
environment: a cautious breeze rises. leaves scud across the gravel.
environment: a windowpane rattles, up high, the corridor thatched in shadow. slowly... camera begins to move. creeping forward. a shadow engulfs sir cadogan, dozing against his tree...
ron: aaaahhhh! harry bolts up, sees a silhouette etched on the window -- a man clutching a knife. all the boys are up now. screaming. amid the chaos, harry grabs his wand.
harry: show yourself. crash! the water glass shatters on the floor and scabbers darts past harry's bare feet, chased by crookshanks. seizing the moment, the silhouette grasps the curtains and swings through the open window, plunging into the night. harry rushes to the window, looks down.
environment: harry sweeps ron's curtains aside. his bed is... empty.
ron: is he gone?
ron: i don't know how he got in! i was a bit busy dodging his knife! just then, a curiously content crookshanks wends his way through ron's legs.
hermione: that's a lie!
dumbledore: sir cadogan. is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter gryffindor tower tonight?
neville: i'm afraid so, ma'am. professor mcgonagall (to the group at large) while we know sirius black is gone tonight, i think you can safely assume he will, at some future time, attempt to return. let me be clear. you are not to move about the castle alone. and you are not to write down the password! understood! a collective nod of the head. mcgonagall gives the ties of her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits. professor mcgonagall very well then. go to bed. as the students drift off, ron casts a last angry glance toward hermione, who now holds crookshanks in her arms.
harry: he was right there. close enough to touch. i could've killed him.
ron: i find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.
ron: harry was there! he'll tell you how it was. go on, harry, tell her.
ron: really? wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons! a person could die being your friend, harry! ron stops, wishes he could take it back. they all wish he could. avoiding each other's eyes, they turn, continue on.
hermione: how'd it go, hagrid?
hermione: i meant the hearing.
hermione: (dreading it) and...? hagrid slings another rock into water.
ron: draco. it's him the committee should punish. it's him they should send off to the forest, not buckbeak.
hermione: (dreading the answer) where's he going, hagrid?
environment: dark. ominous. dementors drift in the distance. restless...
environment: harry moves down a dark corridor, map in hand, wand aglow. in the paintings he passes, the subjects snore
insert - marauder's map: "harry potter" and "peter pettigrew" draw closer and closer.
himself: ... reflected in a mirror. he blinks, startled, then glances back down at the map. pettigrew has moved past him. confused, harry wheels, casts his wand along the walls.
harry: mischief managed! harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and turns... into the harsh glare of snape's wand.
harry: i was... i was... sleepwalking... a sneer curdles the corners of snape's lips.
harry: my dad didn't strut. nor do i. now, if you don't mind, i'd appreciate you lowering your wand. snape eyes harry coldly. containing himself. lowers his wand.
snape: turn out your pockets! finally, harry obliges. seeing the map, snape's eyes glitter.
harry: spare bit of parchment...
snape: read it.
snape: go on.
snape: (smile drooping) why you insolent little --
snape: well, well. lupin. out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
snape: that remains to be seen. i've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from mr. potter. take a look, lupin. this is supposed to be your area of expertise. lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of snape and a pair of potions.
professor lupin: i seriously doubt that, severus. it looks to me as if it merely insults anyone who tries to read it. i suspect it's a zonko product. nevertheless, i shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. as you say, it's my area of expertise. come, harry.
professor lupin: i don't know how this map came to be in your possession, harry, but i'm astounded that you didn't turn it in. did you ever stop to think that this -- in the hands of sirius black -- is a map to you? harry walks silently. lupin can barely contain his anger.
harry: professor. just so you know, i don't think the map always works. earlier, it showed someone in the castle. someone i know to be dead.
harry: peter pettigrew. lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his papers.
professor lupin: if you do. i'll know.
closeup - crystal ball: murky with smoke.
environment: the students gaze into crystal balls, faces reflecting the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made of smoke. conspicuously, harry, ron and hermione sit apart.
hermione: here we go again. it's the grim! it's the grim!
lavender: 'in late spring, one of our number will leave us forever!' you knew, professor! you saw.
environment: as the students exit, ron, walking separately from harry, turns to neville.
environment: harry sets hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts to go, when... the smoke within the crystal suddenly darkens. leaning close, harry watches the shape that appears. it is unmistakable: sirius black. just then, a shadow crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and... ... a hand snatches harry's shoulder. he wheels, finds...
professor trelawney: he will return tonight.... harry stiffens. trelawney's voice is eerily hollow.
professor trelawney: tonight, when the clock strikes twelve, the servant shall break free. he and his master shall be reunited. it cannot be prevented. trelawney smiles savagely... then her head falls forward. when it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon harry's shoulder. her hand.
harry: no. nothing.
hermione: i can't believe they're going to kill buckbeak! it's too horrible.
draco: did you see the big, fat blubbering oaf?! oh, this is going to be rich. did i tell you, father said i can keep the head -- (looking up) ah. come to see the show?
ron: hermione! no! she turns, surprised ron's spoken to her. he looks away.
hermione: that felt good.
environment: the trio makes their way down the slope and past buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.
hagrid: look at 'em. loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows...
hagrid: (shaking his head) they'd know i did it. and tha' would only get dumbledore in trouble. gonna come down, yeh know. says he wants ter be with me when it... when it happens. great man, dumbledore.
hagrid: yeh will not! think i wan' yeh seein' a thing like this! no. yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off. but before yeh do -- i wan' ter see you an' ron shake hands, harry. ron and harry exchange a glance, then look to hagrid.
hagrid: good. now then. ron, i wan' ter see you give hermione a hug.
hagrid: go on! you two've been at it all year. an' i'm sick o' it. acutely uncomfortable, hermione and ron step forward and perform perhaps the most awkward hug hogwarts has ever seen.
ron: i'm not kissing fang if that's what you're thinking... hearing his name, fang -- hagrid's giant boarhound -- thumps his tail happily on the floor. hagrid turns, takes the lid from a flour tin, a tiny head, ears flecked with powder, emerges.
hagrid: yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, ron.
ron: right. next time i see crookshanks, i'll let him know.
hagrid: crikey. here we go agin... smash! a glass jar on the shelf shatters. as hermione scoops up a jagged star-shaped stone, a second stone bounces off the back of harry's head.
harry: hagrid... everyone turns. looks. dumbledore and fudge approach. behind them, in a fluttering shroud of crows, the executioner follows, axe at his side. hagrid begins to panic.
harry: c'mon.
environment: as the trio exit through the back door, fudge, dumbledore and the executioner enter through the front.
environment: a veil of crows flutters onto the roof. more drop into the patch, begin to slowly circle buckbeak. harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch hagrid solemnly greet the others. fudge appears at the window. picks his nose. just then, a shhh! is heard. hermione turns. the branches of the trees behind her are
harry: what?
environment: the trio slip silently into a stand of trees. beyond them, hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun. high in the clock tower, a bell begins to toll.
ding!: all goes very still. the wind loses its voice...
ding!: the sun sets, dropping behind the mountains in the distance. hermione turns. sees a frenzied spray of crows stain the bloody sky, their primal shrieking rising like a curse. slowly, hermione's hand falls onto ron's shoulder and camera falls with her, continuing down the length of ron's arm to his hand, where a drop of blood hangs from his finger, drops like a tear...
ron: he bit me... his eyes shift. see scabbers streaking away.
environment: ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top. hermione and harry follow.
hermione: harry. you do realize what tree this is... ron nabs scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm.
harry: that's not good. (yelling) ron! run! ron spins. looks toward harry.
ron: aaaahhh! the dog's teeth flash and -- snap! -- close on ron's foot, dragging him towards the trunk like a rag doll. instantly, harry dashes forward, leaps out, and grabs ron's hands... but he and ron just keep skudding along the ground.
ron: harry! harry raises his chin. the dog vanishes into the gap at the base of the tree, begins to pull ron through...
harry: no, ron... one by one, ron releases his fingers from harry's forearm. sacrificing himself.
harry and hermione's pov - the branches overhead: swaying beautifully against the dusky sky, swishing softly.
hermione: haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!! harry squints up, sees a pile-driving fist of a branch screaming straight down for his head. he rolls away just as -- whomp! -- the branch pulverizes the ground. hermione whips through frame, still clinging on for dear life, and harry rises. flumph! -- he's promptly knocked to the ground again. hermione goes crashing through the high branches, harry spies his glasses and grabs them. rising, he fits them to his face and...
harry: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! hermione reaches out, grabs harry's shirt and -- riding the branch in tandem -- the two boomerang back, hurtling toward the trunk of the tree, through the gap, and into the darkness...
hermione: thanks.
hermione: where do you suppose this goes?
environment: harry and hermione make their way through the primitive passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead. then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends. confused, harry and hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up. a small opening. harry reaches up, hoists himself through.
hermione: we're in the shrieking shack, aren't we? harry doesn't answer, staring at the dog prints in the dust on the floor. the ceiling creaks. they dash to the stairs.
harry: nox.
environment: his wand-light dies. slowly, they step to the door. exchange a look. she nods, wand ready, and harry kicks the door aside.
hermione: ron! you're okay --
ron: he's the dog. it's a trap, harry. he's an animagus... harry looks down, follows the paw prints on the floor to a pair of filthy human feet. harry looks up slowly at the man standing in the shadows. filthy, matted hair hangs to his shoulders. his skin like a corpse.
hermione: if you want to kill harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!
harry: then it'll be you!
sirius black: going to kill me, harry?
harry: professor lupin! lupin ignores them, eying black intensely.
hermione: professor lupin! lupin ignores them, eying black intensely.
ron: professor lupin! lupin ignores them, eying black intensely.
sirius black: you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, remus? the two regard each other, the moment taut with tension, then lupin steps forward and... embraces black like a brother.
professor lupin: how long have you known?
professor lupin: you're the brightest witch of your age i've ever met, hermione.
professor lupin: wait, sirius --
professor lupin: all right then. as you wish...
harry: you betrayed my parents! you sold them to voldemort!
professor lupin: harry! you've got to listen --
sirius black: no! i wasn't there! and i'll regret it the rest of my life! harry's eyes flash to black's, glittering with pain.
sirius black: he's as good as dead.
sirius black: oh yes there is... black turns then, to ron, and croons in a cruel sing song:
ron: you're mad... harry's eyes shift from ron's face to his hands, where scabbers twists violently. as a curious expression befalls harry, lupin and black, as one, raise their wands... when.
snape: (eying black) ah, vengeance is sweet. how i hoped i'd be the one to catch you.
snape: i told dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. and here's the proof.
snape: give me a reason. i beg you.
sirius black: he can't help it. it's habit by now.
snape: (clucking his tongue) listen to you two. quarreling like an old married couple. the creature and the criminal.
snape: witty as ever i see. tell me, will you be so irreverent when i turn you over to the dementors? (as black reacts) do i detect a flicker of fear? one can only imagine what it must be like to endure the dementor's kiss. it's said to be unbearable to witness. but i'll do my best. snape's eyes harden. he gestures to the door.
harry: expelliarmus! snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a thud, and slides down. ron and hermione stare in shock.
harry: you said peter before. peter who?
harry: he killed no. pettigrew's dead. him. as harry points at black, black laughs mirthlessly.
harry: the map was lying then --
ron: m-me? it's lunatic...
ron: scabbers? scabbers has been in my family for --
ron: so what?
sirius black: finger. dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead. then he transformed into a rat.
environment: harry stares into black's sunken eyes. wanting to believe. desperate to believe. glances at ron, his agonized face. scabbers squirms violently.
ron: what are you going to do to him? sirius and lupin exchange a glance.
pettigrew: harry! look at you! y-you look just like your father. like james. we were the best of friends, he and i --
pettigrew: i didn't mean to! the dark lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses! ask yourself what you would have done, sirius. what would you have done!
professor lupin: we would.
pettigrew: sweet girl. clever girl. surely you won't let them... as one, lupin and black raise their wands, point them directly into pettigrew's face. he shrinks back trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...
professor lupin: harry, this man...
pettigrew: bless you, boy! bless you --
pettigrew: turn me into a maggot. a dung beetle. a flobberworm! anything but the dementors... (as ron emerges) ron! haven't i been a good friend? a good pet? you won't let them kill me, will you? i was your rat... as ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking snape bumps his head against a low limb. hermione turns to harry.
pettigrew: sweet girl. clever girl. surely you won't let them... hermione tugs her robes from pettigrew's sweaty grasp. harry turns, sees black staring in wonder at the castle, shining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.
harry: i don't reckon my father'd want his best friends to become killers for a worthless piece of vermin like pettigrew. besides: dead, the truth dies with him. alive... you're free.
environment: sirius studies harry's profile, moved by this.
harry: i know.
harry: when! come live with you?
hermione: harry... he turns, see hermione staring at the full moon. his eyes shift. lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers twitching.
sirius black: run. all of you. now. but none of them do, transfixed, watching as bristles poke through lupin's skin. black steps forward, wraps his arms around his friend, presses his mouth to his ear.
environment: sirius black (cont'dpounding lupin's chest) this heart is where you truly live. this heart! here! as lupin's wand drops... pettigrew leaps.
hermione: professor...? the werewolf's eyes blaze. long teeth glitter. then... a horrifying growl erupts from its throat. harry and hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into snape. as they collapse in a great clumsy pile, snape's eyes flutter open, the spell broken. seeing hermione atop him, he sweeps her aside...
harry: sirius! the dog yelps, roars in pain, and the werewolf flings it into the tall grass. as it charges after, harry pushes past snape, dashes into the night. hermione makes to follow, but snape holds her back.
harry: please, professor. stop... it's me. suddenly... a howl pierces the night. the werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest. harry waits, petrified. the werewolf's eyes shift back to him. it snarls, moves closer, ready to kill. harry covers his face with his arm, when... ... a second howl echoes high above the forest. slowly, harry drops his arm. looks. the werewolf bounds toward the forest, vanishes. harry's eyes shift. in the darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass. falls. rises. falls again. each time becoming more human. as he disappears over the ridge, harry sprints after.
harry: sirius! harry looks into his glassy eyes.
harry: no... no! (drawing his wand) expecto... patronum! a thin silvery wisp weeps from harry's wand, hovering like a veil, but the dementors continue to come. harry places his hand on black's heaving heart, poises his wand once more:
environment: camera pulls back slowly... out of hermione's shadow, which ripples against the curtain that encircles harry's bed. a hand reaches out -- harry's hand -- and sweeps the curtain aside. ron lies opposite, his leg bandaged. hermione paces. stops.
harry: i saw my dad.
harry: he sent the dementors away... i saw him. across the lake... hermione exchanges a private glance with ron, turns back.
harry: the kiss...?
harry: you mean, they're going to kill sirius?
hermione: headmaster! you've got to stop them! they've got the wrong man!
ron: it's scabbers who did it!
ron: my rat, sir. only he's not really well, he was a rat. you a rat. see, he used to be my brother percy's --
dumbledore: i do, miss granger. but i'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others. a child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. as dumbledore turns to the window, a shooting star plummets silently through the sky.
dumbledore: by the way, when in doubt, i find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... good luck. he smiles, exits. harry glances curiously at the chocolate.
hermione: sorry, ron. but seeing as you can't walk... as ron and harry exchange a curious glance, the bell continues to chime -- ding! ding! -- and...
afternoon: time reverses in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while, outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the sun "un-sets," returning to its place low on the horizon. at this point, the time reversal ends and the room is... empty. except for harry and hermione. as hermione unloops the necklace, harry glances around in confusion.
hermione: seven-thirty. where were we at seven-thirty?
hermione: come on! we can't be seen! hermione grabs harry's arm, slams through the door.
harry: hermione! will you please tell me what it is we're doing?! she holds up a hand, silencing him. annoyed, harry follows her gaze and blinks in disbelief. across the grounds...
harry: but that... that's... us. this is not... normal.
hermione: this is a time-turner, harry. mcgonagall gave it to me first term. this is how i've been getting to my lessons all year.
hermione: yes. dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. clearly something happened he wants us to change.
environment: a soft smack is heard. they turn, see malfoy land on the seat of his pants in the sundial garden, rub his kisser.
hermione: hurry! malfoy's coming! hermione pulls harry under the bridge. seconds later, footsteps clamor over their heads.
harry: look. buckbeak's still alive.
harry: buckbeak? but... how will saving buckbeak help sirius?
environment: as buckbeak feasts on a ferret, harry and hermione duck behind a pile of pumpkins. peering into the hut, harry sees hermione and ron embrace awkwardly.
environment: he grins, turns, only to find hermione analyzing the moment with considerable fascination. caught -- regards harry defensively.
harry: nothing. harry looks toward the slope, sees fudge and the others approaching in a cloud of crows.
hermione: no! fudge has to see buckbeak before we steal him. otherwise, he'll think hagrid set him free! harry nods, then looks toward the hut. inside, hagrid is handing scabbers to ron.
hermione: no, harry! you can't!
hermione: yes! you must! (pointing inside) harry, you're in hagrid's hut right now. if you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad. awful things can happen when wizards meddle with time. we can't be seen. hermione turns, watches fudge and the others drawing closer. she frowns, glances into the hut.
harry: are you mad? hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone through the window and -- conk! -- off the back of harry's head.
hermione: sorry. crows begin to drop atop the roof. fudge's party arrives, raps on the door.
hermione: is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
environment: nothing, i just thought i saw... never mind.
environment: harry and hermione watch themselves start up the slope. the coast clear, they slip out of the trees.
environment: 'it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown...' as harry approaches, buckbeak studies him curiously, a ferret leg dangling from his beak. harry bows. slurp! the ferret leg disappears and buckbeak returns harry's nod. as harry takes buckbeak's chain... a flint-eyed crow pecks his hand.
environment: 'the committee's appointed executioner shall dispatch the condemned by means of beheading...'
environment: 'as witnessed below.' you sign here, hagrid. very well, gentlemen. let's step outside, shall we... ding! the hogwarts bell begins to toll. harry and hermione exchange a glance. harry tugs harder. no go.
hermione: here, beaky... come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum... harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's... working. as buckbeak trots after, the cawing crows scatter.
dumbledore: professor dippet had those blackberries planted when he was headmaster... harry and hermione shoo buckbeak along, disappear into the forest... just as dumbledore concludes his reverie.
cornelius fudge: but... where is it? i just saw the beast not moments ago -- hagrid?
dumbledore: (a hint of amusement) how extraordinary!
hagrid: professor, i swear! i didn't!
cornelius fudge: we should search the grounds --
sickening chop!: the crows scatter to the skies.
harry: now what?
harry: and we do that... how?
environment: subjective pov, gliding through a thicket of trees, to the forest's edge, the trees thinning, revealing...
harry: wait until fred and george hear about that one.
harry: and now we wait.
hermione: 'least someone's enjoying himself. harry and hermione sit together in the lengthening shadows. harry snaps off a piece of chocolate, hands it to hermione.
hermione: yes?
hermione: with a patronus. i heard snape telling dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital. according to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
harry: it was my dad who conjured the patronus.
harry: dead. i know. i'm just telling you what i saw. hermione nods, not wanting to press harry further, then glances beyond the trees, toward the whomping willow.
environment: shadows emerge under a full moon: black. harry. pettigrew. lupin. hermione. ron. sleepwalking snape...
harry: you see sirius talking to me? he's asking me to come live with him.
harry: when we free him, i'll never have to go back to the dursley's. i'm going to tell him i'd like to live someplace in the country. i think he'd like that, after all those years in azkaban. we don't need a big place and i can help him... a howl pierces the night. hermione glances toward the willow.
harry: which means pettigrew is slipping safely into the night. while we just stand here... a fierce growling is heard as twin silhouettes -- the dog and the werewolf -- bound into the tall grass. harry watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before. the werewolf turns, begins to stalk... owwwwwwwww! harry wheels, sees hermione, hands cupped to her mouth, making a loud howl. he covers her mouth.
hermione: saving your life. harry looks back to the tall grass. the werewolf is frozen. as before, it begins to approach harry again. owwwwwwww! this time, harry doesn't stop her.
hermione: why?
hermione: buckbeak. we've got to find him. ... and reveals the werewolf, fifteen feet past, waiting. as harry and hermione step out, they freeze. the werewolf poises itself, preparing to pounce, when... skreeek! the trees shake with the fury of a hurricane and buckbeak charges into the clearing, screening harry and hermione. the werewolf snarls angrily, makes to charge. with lightning-fast reflexes, buckbeak's claws slash the air... only inches from the werewolf's face. the werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then... howls. turning, it vanishes into the forest.
harry: let's go.
moving pov: looking upward... through the trees as the sky wheels by, dementors streaking in and out of view.
environment: camera rushes in, holds on harry and hermione's faces.
environment: shocked. terror-stricken. opposite them, across the lake...
intercut between black lake and edge of forest.: harry watches himself vainly attempt to conjure a patronus as the cyclone only continues to grow...
harry: don't worry. my dad will come... right there... you'll see... he'll come... any minute... he'll conjure the patronus hermione eyes harry warily. he is transfixed, staring hungrily toward the outcrop. the wind rises. the lake begins to freeze. whoosh! whoosh! one after another, dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone...
harry: he will! he will come! she looks. nothing. desperately, her eyes flash to the cyclone, to the pitiful sight of harry and black at the water's edge... wracked with pain... dying...
environment: whoosh! harry and hermione plunge into frame astride buckbeak, soaring toward the castle. outside the grounds, the dementors wait restlessly. up ahead, fudge and snape enter the dark tower, torches in hand.
hermione: no. (looking down in fear) but i don't like this!
environment: we see buckbeak land.
environment: sirius paces within a small cell, a man condemned. spying harry and hermione, he stops. stunned to see them.
environment: hermione pushes past harry.
hermione: didn't really expect that to work.
environment: wand flashing, hermione tries spell after spell.
sirius black: you might try --
sirius black: that'll do.
environment: sirius laughs, hair blowing in the wind.
environment: black puts his hands to hermione's waist, swings her off buckbeak and onto the ground next to harry.
harry: i want to go with you.
sirius black: but promise me something, harry.
sirius black: trust yourself. no matter the challenges you face -- and i fear they will be many -- you'll be surprised how many times you can find the answers... (tapping his heart) ...here. as sirius climbs atop buckbeak, a shooting star arcs through the heavens.
hermione: we have to go.
environment: as harry and hermione dash off, camera tracks after, rising with them as they race up the tower stairway, then passing through the mechanism and on through to the end of...
dumbledore: by the way, when in doubt, i always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... good luck. as dumbledore begins to close the door, harry and hermione stumble frantically forward, the door about to hit the jamb, when... suddenly... dumbledore stops. looks up.
harry: he's free -- sirius. we... we did it.
environment: ... they catch the faintest glimpse of... themselves... across the room... just as they evaporate. ron blinks. turns. frowns.
hermione: what d'you think, harry? too much for him -- everything that's happened tonight?
environment: the whomping willow sways in a light breeze. the black lake shimmers, clouds drifting in its glassy mirror.
professor lupin: hello, harry. harry jumps. lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.
professor lupin: i've looked worse, believe me. harry eyes the open desk drawers... the bare bookshelves...
professor lupin: resigned, actually.
professor lupin: it seems that someone has let slip the nature of my condition.
professor lupin: whoever. it was bound to get out. this time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving. parents will not want a -- someone like me -- teaching their children.
professor lupin: has already risked enough on my behalf. besides, people like me, well... let's just say i'm used to this by now. but before i go, tell me about your patrons.
professor lupin: a stag.
professor lupin: your father used to transform into one. that's how he was able to keep me company when i became... sick. he was a great friend james. lupin smiles wanly, lifts his sorry suitcase. then stops.
professor lupin: mischief managed. harry watches the map go blank. looks back. lupin is gone.
environment: ron stands amid a circle of excited gryffindors.
neville: harry! wherever did you get it!
ron: quiet! (as they oblige) thank you. let the man through. mystified, harry steps forward, the boys peeling away, clearing his view of the broomstick in ron's hands. the
harry: whose is that?
harry: who? but... how?
harry: that's a hippogriff feather -- as harry stops short, hermione raises her eyebrow. as they share a secret glance, we...
environment: boom! the huge vertical doors burst open and harry, trailed by the others, exits with the firebolt. as he strides off, others join the assembly -- hagrid, malfoy, crabbe, and goyle among them -- curious to see what the commotion is all about.
seamus: go on, harry.
fred: what's wrong?
george: what's wrong?
harry: oh, come on now. it's just a broom.
harry: the fastest broom in the world. as everyone turns -- whoosh! -- harry jets off and we --
environment: a tiny dot, growing larger and larger, races upward. it's harry shooting straight into the blue on the firebolt. a scream grows louder as he approaches. a scream of release, of utter abandon. it's harry screaming. but something else is clear as he jets past and... the screen goes black. it's a scream of joy.
