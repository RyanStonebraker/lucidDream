harry,lumos maxima... the tent blooms softly with light -- briefly illuminating a bedside photograph (of james &amp; lily potter) -- then goes dark.,2,3
harry,"lumos maxima... as the blankets blaze, we cut inside, find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: harry potter. open before him is violeta stitch's extreme incantations. once again, he speaks:",3,3
environment,a blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of number four. dogs bark. and a title card appears:,4,3
environment,"the light in the hallway snaps on, harry's tent droops once more and, seconds later, harry's door eases open. uncle vernon peers in and switches on the light. the room is utterly silent. slowly, he closes the door.",5,3
environment,"harry! harry! harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall, where his aunt petunia and cousin dudley stand stiffly. petunia flicks a bit of fluff from dudley's sweater, glowers crossly at harry, and jerks her head toward the door.",6,3
aunt petunia,marge! welcome! how was the train?,7,3
aunt petunia,ah. how... unfortunate.,8,3
harry,uncle vernon. i need you to sign this form.,9,3
harry,nothing. something for school... uncle vernon eyes the parchment in harry's hand suspiciously.,10,3
harry,i will if she does.,11,3
harry,yes.,12,3
aunt marge,"is that my dudders! hm? is that my neffy poo? come and say hello to your auntie marge. marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes. dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. harry looks on, then sees ripper snuffling about his ankle.",13,3
uncle vernon,"can i tempt you, marge?",14,3
aunt marge,"what are you smirking at! where is it that you send him, vernon?",15,3
aunt marge,"i see. and do they use the cane at st. brutus's, boy?",16,3
aunt marge,"excellent. i won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. (another sip) still. mustn't blame yourself for how this one's turned out, vernon. it all comes down to blood. bad blood will out. what is it the boy's father did, petunia?",17,3
aunt marge,"of course. and a drunk, i expect --",18,3
aunt marge,what did you say?,19,3
aunt petunia,oh my goodness! marge!,20,3
uncle vernon,you go to bed. now.,21,3
harry,"shut up! shut up! aunt marge starts to reply, when -- zing! -- a button on her dress sails into the air. seams groan. thread snaps. aunt marge's eyes widen. her cheeks billow. her whole body billows. and she begins to inflate like a",22,3
environment,"the others race outside. as aunt marge begins to float away, uncle vernon grips her hands.",23,3
aunt marge,vernon. don't you dare -- but he does. he lets go. falls to his knees. and watches aunt marge float away.,24,3
environment,boom! boom! boom! harry tows the trunk down the stairs... finds uncle vernon waiting for him.,25,3
harry,"no! she deserved what she got! and you... you keep away from me. uncle vernon eyes harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty.",26,3
harry,anywhere's better than here.,27,3
environment,"harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. glances about. an empty playground. swings creaking gently on rusted chains. a tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. harry drops the trunk. sits. deep in the night, an alarm shrieks, goes silent. harry, still as a statue. listening. in the trees above, leaves tremble. the wind gathers. harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel. then, he... stiffens. turns back. sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises. slowly draws his wand. then he sees... it. something big. darker than the shadows which conceal it. something with wide, gleaming",28,3
harry,"aaaah! giant wheels bear down. harry rolls clear -- just as a preposterously purple, triple-decker bus screeches to a halt. gold letters glimmer above the windscreen: the knight bus. doors hiss. snap back. reveal stan shunpike, an 18- year-old boy in a wrinkled conductor's uniform. pasty face. raccoon eyes. stan looks like he hasn't seen the sun in years.",29,3
harry,fell over.,30,3
harry,"i didn't do it on purpose. stan eyes harry suspiciously, nods slowly.",31,3
environment,"no seats. only beds. the brass frames need a shine, the lines a wash. in one bed, a disheveled wizard grunts, turns over in his sleep.",32,3
stan shunpike,"take 'er away, ern.",33,3
stan shunpike,wot you say your name was again?,34,3
stan shunpike,whereabouts you headin'? harry hesitates. he hadn't thought about this. decides.,35,3
stan shunpike,"is it now? get that, ern? the leaky cauldron. that's in london. stan grins with sinister delight, showing bad teeth.",36,3
harry,isn't this a bit... dangerous?,37,3
shrunken head,"heads up! little old lady at twelve o'clock! sure enough, directly ahead, a little old lady is crossing the street. ernie hits the brakes hard and harry flies forward, palms to the window. the brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and harry flies back onto his bed. bang! the bus rockets forward once more. as harry rights himself, he notices the headline of stan's daily prophet: escape from azkaban! below, a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair glowers from a",38,3
harry,who is that? that man.,39,3
stan shunpike,"a murderer, he is. got 'imself locked up in azkaban for it.",40,3
stan shunpike,"tha's the question, isn't it? he's the firs' that's done it. gives me the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, i'll tell you that. big supporter of you- know-'oo, black was. reckon you heard o' him. harry nods and, as he does, black's eyes shift. meet harry's.",41,3
shrunken head,hate that.,42,3
stan shunpike,"them! don' listen properly, do they? don' look properly either. never notice nuffink, they don'. just then, a couple walking a dog are engulfed by a rush of wind as the (invisible) knight bus whooshes past. the couple glances about in bewilderment. the dog yaps madly.",43,3
environment,"the chandelier sways drunkenly as the bus doors open. the steps groan with heavy feet and a figure appears: tom, innkeeper of the leaky cauldron pub.",44,3
environment,"as the knight bus rockets off, tom and harry are revealed, harry glances up, reads the sign above: the leaky cauldron. tom drags harry's trunk inside, then pauses and, with a flick of his wand, silences the car alarm.",45,3
environment,"harry trails tom through the quiet room. the bartender glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. a solitary wizard reads a book while, at his elbow, his coffee cup stirs itself. tom leads harry upstairs.",46,3
harry,hedwig!,47,3
cornelius fudge,"i should tell you, mr. potter, earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located just south of sheffield, circling a chimney stack. the accidental magic reversal department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified. she has no recollection of the incident whatsoever. harry waits. a man condemned. then fudge turns.",48,3
harry,no thank you. minister... i don't understand. i broke the law. underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --,49,3
harry,'the state of things' sir?,50,3
harry,"sirius black, you mean. but... what's that got to do with me? crack! tom shatters another walnut. fudge smiles nervously.",51,3
cornelius fudge,"by the way, harry. whilst you're here it would be best if you didn't... wander.",52,3
environment,"through the window: the rooftops of london. a train passes and camera pulls back, reveals harry, standing with hedwig. he turns, eyes his schoolbooks. he studies the growling tome -- the monster book of monsters -- then gives the rope a tug. instantly... ... the book leaps to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers snapping. harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins nipping viciously at his shoes. harry vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a",53,3
environment,a young witch in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall. harry exits his room as the witch knocks on a door.,54,3
young witch,(unperturbed) i'll come back later.,55,3
environment,"something small and fast dashes by harry's feet. looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking rat (scabbers), pursued by a decidedly ugly orange cat (crookshanks).",56,3
environment,"as harry moves down the stairs, voices come from below.",57,3
environment,"he's a cat, ronald! what do you expect? it's in his nature. as harry reaches bottom, he finds ron weasley protectively cradling scabbers, while hermione grander does her best to restrain a hissing crookshanks.",58,3
hermione,"that's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. (cooing to the cat) it's all right, crookshanks. you just ignore the mean little boy... then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.",59,3
"a headline screams: ""grand prize winner visits egypt!""","in the accompanying photo, the entire weasley family stands before the great pyramids, waving. smack in the middle is ron, scabbers perched on his shoulder.",60,3
harry,egypt! what's it like?,61,3
hermione,"you know, the ancient egyptians of the nile river delta worshipped the cat goddess bast. ron glares stonily at hermione, then turns back to harry.",62,3
george,"not flashing that clipping about again, are you, ron?",63,3
fred,"no, not a soul. unless you count tom. the day maid. the night maid. the cook. the bloke that came to fix the toilet. that wizard from belgium... mrs. weasley takes harry's face in her hands, smiles. as if relieved to see him.",64,3
harry,"good to see you too, mrs. weasley.",65,3
harry,"of course, mr. weasley. as mr. weasley pulls harry away, the others continue to hover over the clipping in the b.g.",66,3
ginny,"that's your nose, fred.",67,3
arthur weasley,harry. there are some within the ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what i'm about to tell you. but i think you need to know the facts. because you're in danger. grave danger. harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.,68,3
arthur weasley,"what do you know of sirius black, harry?",69,3
arthur weasley,"harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped... mr. weasley hesitates, unable to continue.",70,3
arthur weasley,"(nodding nervously) black lost everything. but he remains a loyal servant to this day. in his mind, only you stand in the way of... once again, mr. weasley hesitates.",71,3
arthur weasley,"harry, i hate it when you say --",72,3
arthur weasley,"in black's mind, only you stand in the way of... you-know-who returning to power. that's why he's broken. that's why he's broken out of azkaban. to find you. and... mr. weasley hesitates yet again.",73,3
arthur weasley,harry. i want you to swear that -- whatever you might hear -- you won't go looking for black.,74,3
arthur weasley,"just watch yourself, will you, harry?",75,3
mrs. weasley,ron! she hands scabbers through the open window to him.,76,3
harry,i didn't mean to blow her up. i just... (troubled by the memory) ... lost control.,77,3
hermione,"honestly, ron, it's not funny. harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.",78,3
harry,"hi, neville. as he bumps past, hermione nods to a compartment.",79,3
hermione,"hi, neville. as he bumps past, hermione nods to a compartment.",79,3
ron,"hi, neville. as he bumps past, hermione nods to a compartment.",79,3
environment,"as they slip inside, they find a man in shabby robes (professor lupin) slumped against the window, asleep. he looks ill, exhausted. the trio eye him warily. whisper.",82,3
hermione,professor r.j. lupin.,83,3
hermione,"it's on his case. she points. stamped in peeling letters on a battered case is ""professor r.j. lupin.""",84,3
hermione,"seems to be. why? what is it, harry?",85,3
environment,"ron and hermione stare at harry, faces stricken in the lantern light that now glows in the compartment. crookshanks slumbers in his cage.",86,3
harry,yes.,87,3
ron,"sure -- of course, no one's ever broken out of azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic... just then, the compartment rattles. lanterns flicker. the train lurches, begins to slow. hermione slides down the seat, pinning ron against the window. they exchange an awkward glance, then hermione carefully slides to the other end of the seat and glances at her watch. frowns.",88,3
environment,... die. one by one. until all is...,89,3
ron,what's going on?,90,3
environment,a thin wisp of steam escapes ron's mouth. harry notices.,91,3
hermione,"ouch! ron, that was my foot! squeak-squeak-squeak. ron, a dark silhouette against the window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.",92,3
ron,"bloody hell. what's happening? ssssst! a soft crackling fills the car and flames bloom... in the hands of r.j. lupin. in the shivering light, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert. wary.",93,3
hermione,"harry? harry, are you all right? hermione's troubled face hovers above him. he nods. sits up. ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand. harry's glasses.",94,3
professor lupin,chocolate. eat. it'll help.,95,3
professor lupin,a dementor. one of the guards of azkaban. it's gone now. harry frowns in confusion.,96,3
professor lupin,"i need to have a word with the driver. excuse me. (the chocolate) eat. it'll help. as he leaves, harry turns to ron and hermione.",97,3
ron,"well, you sort of went... rigid. we thought maybe you were having a fit or something.",98,3
ron,no. i felt... weird. like i'd never be cheerful again. but... no. harry turns to hermione. she shakes her head.,99,3
harry,but someone was screaming. a woman. hermione and ron glance nervously at each other.,100,3
dumbledore,"welcome! welcome to another year at hogwarts! i have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. i myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair... mcgonagall clears her throat.",101,3
dumbledore,"as some of you may know, professor kettleburn, our care of magical creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. fortunately, i'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own rubeus hagrid!",102,3
environment,"harry, ron, and hermione stare at each other -- stunned -- then applaud vigorously. hagrid turns ruby red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending water goblets weaving.",103,3
dumbledore,"the dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. while they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities. under no circumstances are you to approach them. it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.",104,3
environment,"harry, ron and hermione arrive at the seventh floor landing and approach the fat lady in the portrait.",105,3
environment,"the gryffindors trail through the common room, the girls heading one way, boys the other.",106,3
ron,"good to be home, eh, harry? harry turns -- caught -- and finds ron studying him from his own bed, scabbers cradled in his hand. harry nods and turns to the window..",107,3
environment,harry continues to stare.,108,3
environment,"as bridge and castle glimmer in the distance, hagrid emerges from the forbidden forest, dragging a fistful of dead ferrets by the tail. a bird appears, circles his head playfully, chirp-chirp-chirping merrily before it... ... flutters off, pin-wheeling past flowers, into a birdbath, finally coming to rest upon... ... an ancient tree. it twitters cheerfully, singing its lovely song, when -- thwock! -- a branch punts the bird into the air. as feathers fly, the whomping willow resumes its shape.",109,3
environment,"harry, ron and hermione sit on fat little pouffes in a murky, incense-laden room, along with neville, dean, seamus, lavender brown, parvati patil and others.",110,3
professor trelawney,"... the sight. hello. i am professor trelawney. together, we shall cast ourselves into the future. but know this. one either has the gift or not. it cannot be divined from the pages of a book. books only cloud one's inner eye.",111,3
ron,where'd you come from?,112,3
professor trelawney,"(spinning on neville) you, boy! is your grandmother well?",113,3
professor trelawney,"i wouldn't be so sure of that. (continuing) the first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves. if all goes well, we will proceed to palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. (eyeing parvati) by the way, dear, beware a red- haired man.",114,3
environment,parvati eyes ron dubiously. edges her pouffe away.,115,3
professor trelawney,well then. shall we?,116,3
teacup - detail - later,"inside, a cloud of tea leaves mutates oddly. harry, sitting opposite ron now, frowns at the leaves, consults the symbols in the textbook (unfogging the future) at his elbow. trelawney walks amongst them, robes flowing.",117,3
professor trelawney,"a five-leaf clover... you can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear. (then, casually) mr. longbottom, after you've broken your first cup... ca-chink! neville fumbles the cup in his hands and the brittle crash of china is heard.",118,3
ron,"well. he's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. but this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. so... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it. professor trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and",119,3
professor trelawney,ahhh!,120,3
professor trelawney,my dear boy... you have the grim.,121,3
parvati,"the grim. not the grin, you idiot.",122,3
lavender,"'the grim...' all turn, see lavender bent over her textbook.",123,3
environment,the trio emerge from the bridge and make their way toward hagrid's hut. the whomping willow looms in the distance.,124,3
ron,ancient runes? exactly how many classes are you taking this term?,125,3
ron,hang on. ancient runes is the same time as divination. you'd have to be in two classes at once.,126,3
environment,"students gather around hagrid as harry, ron and hermione arrive. draco, crabbe, and goyle stand with the slytherins.",127,3
environment,"hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side of the forbidden forest. in the paddock, a freestanding iron rack hangs with dead ferrets, buzzing with flies. nearby is a pumpkin patch.",128,3
draco,and exactly how do we do that?,129,3
environment,"hagrid looks. belts, rope, spellotape: any means available have been employed to bridle the monster book of monsters, which quiver violently.",130,3
hagrid,"righ' then. so... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the magical creatures. right. so... i'll... i'll go an' get 'em. hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. draco shakes his head, speaks loudly to crabbe and goyle.",131,3
harry,"listen, you stupid prat -- eyes widening in fear, malfoy steps back, points.",132,3
hagrid,"gee up, there! (grinning) beau'iful, isn' he?",133,3
environment,"there seems no consensus on this, but the students stare in wary wonder nonetheless. as hagrid coaxes the beast to the center of the paddock, ron stares uneasily.",134,3
hagrid,"a hippogriff, o' course. now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud. easily offended, hippogriffs are. don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh do. right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello? the entire class steps back, leaving harry in front.",135,3
hagrid,"tha's it. easy now... stop! this here's buckbeak, harry. yeh want ter let 'im make the firs' move. it's polite, see? jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. ready? unsure, harry nods anyway. steps forward. and... bows. buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying harry cannily. harry waits. and waits...",136,3
hagrid,"well done, harry! go on. give 'im a pat. tentatively, harry reaches out, lays his hand on buckbeak's fierce beak. the class claps. harry smiles.",137,3
harry,(smile drooping) excuse me?,138,3
hagrid,"off yeh go! as buckbeak gallops forward, harry slides scarily back, giant wings unfold, huge and powerful, and -- whoosh! -- they soar into the air. rising higher. and higher. and higher. gradually, harry loosens his hold on buckbeak's neck. losing himself in the joy of flying. smiling at the sight of his and buckbeak's shadow racing across the grass below. circling over the whomping willow, past hogwarts castle, and then swooping, with heart-stopping speed, over the black lake, buckbeak's talons tickling the smooth glass of the water, summoning the giant squid to the surface briefly. hagrid whistles then, and buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock, galloping to a halt. as harry slides off, the class cheers -- all except draco, who narrows his eyes maliciously.",139,3
harry,"brilliant... professor. they both grin, when draco pushes past them roughly, strides toward buckbeak.",140,3
hagrid,"malfoy! no! in a flash, buckbeak's steely talons slash down. malfoy freezes. looks down at the blood blossoming on his robes. shrieks. instantly, harry dashes forward. buckbeak whips around, raises its talons and -- seeing harry -- lowers them. ducks its beak. harry... realizing what he's done... breathes.",141,3
hagrid,calm yerself! yer fine... jus' a scratch... hagrid looks: a deep gash glistens on draco's limp arm.,142,3
hagrid,"no. i'm the teacher. you all... you all just... class dismissed! and with that, hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the castle.",143,3
pansy,"does it hurt terribly, draco?",144,3
ron,"the little git. he's really laying it on thick, isn't he?",145,3
hermione,yes. but i hear draco's father's furious. i don't think we've heard the end of this...,146,3
ron,who? but the photograph on the prophet's front page provides a chilling answer: sirius black. hermione reads over the shoulders of others. whispers half to herself:,147,3
neville,"you don't think he'd come to hogwarts, do you?",148,3
lavendar,"dementors? he's already slipped by them once, hasn't he? who's to say he can't do it again?",149,3
environment,"as a flicker of fear passes through harry's face, bem, a nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of black.",150,3
environment,"beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then, slowly begin to wither. the dew freezes, the grass grows brittle. seconds later, the dementors sweep by.",151,3
professor lupin,"intriguing, yes? would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's inside?",152,3
professor lupin,"very good, mr. finnigan. can anyone tell us what a boggart looks like?",153,3
ron,when'd she get here?,154,3
professor lupin,"terrifying, yes. luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. let's practice it now, shall we? without wands, please... riddikulus!",155,3
draco,(muttering softly) it's this class that's ridiculous.,156,3
professor lupin,what would you say is the thing that frightens you most?,157,3
professor lupin,"didn't catch that, neville, sorry.",158,3
professor lupin,"hmmm... yes. neville, i believe you live with your grandmother?",159,3
professor lupin,"it won't. but i want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very clearly in your mind. can you do that?",160,3
professor lupin,"that's fine. we don't need to hear it. if you see it, we will. now, when i open this wardrobe, neville, here's what i want you to do... lupin leans close to neville, whispers. neville's eyes pop open in shock. consider lupin uncertainly.",161,3
professor lupin,"right then. wand at the ready. one. two. three! sparks jet from lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe bursts open. instantly, snape appears, eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. neville backs away in fright.",162,3
neville,"r-r-riddikulus! crack! snape stumbles in a flash of light and reappears... in a long, lace-trimmed dress, towering moth-eaten hat, and crimson handbag. instantly, the class roars (except for draco and his fellow slytherins). neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself. lupin drops the needle on an old gramaphone. as a scratchy rhumba fills the room, he points to ron.",163,3
ron,"riddikulus! crack! roller skates materialize on the spider's hairy feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place. instantly, ron relaxes as the class' laughter rings out.",164,3
parvati,"riddikulus! as the vampire whips its cloak across its eyes, we cut behind... so our pov is of the students. swish! the cloak reopens, the class laughs, and we reverse again... see that the vampire is now dressed like carmen miranda. as it begins to shimmy about -- against its will -- the class starts to clap.",165,3
dean thomas,"riddikulus! the cobra's hooded head bobs back and forth, transforms into a jack-in-the-box. lupin grins and...",166,3
professor lupin,"here! crack! -- the dementor vanishes and a roiling mist appears, which becomes clouds. something glows within the clouds, white, silvery and round...",167,3
professor lupin,"well done, everyone. i think that's enough excitement for today. as the students exit, chattering loudly, only harry, subdued, remains behind. at the doorway, lupin glances back, exchanges a private glance with him. as he exits, the wardrobe gives one last rattle.",168,3
harry,"yes, professor, but i thought if you said i could go -- professor mcgonagall but i don't say so. a parent or guardian must sign, and since i am neither, it would be inappropriate. (a flicker of pity) i'm sorry, potter. but that's my final word. ron and hermione -- watching harry expectantly from across the way -- see him turn, shake his head. their faces fall. harry raises his hand in farewell. watches them go.",169,3
environment,thru thru,170,3
professor lupin,"well, don't feel too bad. i was roundly disappointed the first time i went.",171,3
professor lupin,"no. i was just trying to make you feel better. honeydukes' sweets are the best in the world. their pepper imps are so strong you smoke at the ears. and zonko's joke shop may be dangerous, but you can't beat their stink pellets.",172,3
professor lupin,"yes, that too...",173,3
professor lupin,you'd like to know why i stopped you from facing the boggart. (off harry's surprise) i should think it'd be obvious. i assumed the boggart would take the shape of lord voldemort. harry frowns. lupin studies him curiously.,174,3
harry,"i did think of voldemort first. but then, i remembered that night on the train... and the dementors...",175,3
professor lupin,"well, well. i'm impressed. that suggests that what you fear most of all is... fear. very wise.",176,3
professor lupin,dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives. our pain becomes their power.,177,3
professor lupin,"the first time i saw you, harry, i recognized you immediately. not by your scar. by your eyes. they're your mother lily's. (nodding) yes. i knew her. she was there for me at a time when no one else was. we used to talk for hours. she was not only a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman. she had a way of seeing the beauty in whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in themselves... lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.",178,3
professor lupin,"i could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents, harry -- but know this... (eyeing harry intensely) they lived. every moment of every day. you should know that. that's how they'd want to be remembered.",179,3
hermione,"and the post office! it's about 200 owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves, depending on how fast you want your letter to go!",180,3
hermione,"but, i mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. don't you think, ron?",181,3
ron,"if there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin. mind you, fred and george say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but i thought, you know, it can't hurt, given that...",182,3
harry,"i'm glad you had a good time. really. and thanks for this. (eyeing the sneakoscope) rubbish or not, you're right. it can't hurt. with that, harry pops a pepper imp into his mouth.",183,3
ron,never mind.,184,3
environment,"as harry, ron, and hermione climb the stairs, they find a crowd gathering on the seventh floor landing.",185,3
percy,"(pushing past) let me through, please. excuse me, thank you, i'm head boy... (stopping dead) back! all of you! no one is to enter this dormitory until it has been fully searched! harry, ron, and hermione exchange dark glances, when... ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.",186,3
ron,probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor again.,187,3
