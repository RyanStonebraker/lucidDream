I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}",826,1
harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?",827,1
hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...,828,1
ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",829,1
hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",830,1
environment,The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.,831,1
hermione, Is that...a dragon?,832,1
ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.,833,1
hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}",834,1
harry, Norbert?,835,1
hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?",836,1
ron, {laughs},837,1

environment,"Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.",839,1
hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}",840,1
harry, Malfoy.,841,1
hagrid," Oh, dear.",842,1
environment,The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.,843,1
harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.,844,1

harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?,846,1
ron, It's bad.,847,1

harry, 50?!,853,1
mcgonagall," Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.",854,1
environment,"Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.",855,1
draco," Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us.""",856,1
mcgonagall," No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.",857,1
environment,"Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.",858,1
environment,"Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.",859,1
filch," A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?",860,1
hagrid, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.,861,1
hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.",862,1
hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.",863,1
filch," Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.",864,1
draco, The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!,865,1
filch," There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}",866,1
hagrid, Right. Let's go.,867,1
scene," In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.",868,1
harry," Hagrid, what's that?",869,1
hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.",870,1
ron, {weakly} Okay.,871,1
hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}",872,1

hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}",874,1
environment,"Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.",875,1

draco," Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.",878,1
environment,"The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.",879,1

draco," {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!",883,1
environment,"Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards.

firenze," Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.",885,1
harry, {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?,886,1
firenze," A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.",887,1
harry, But who would choose such a life?,888,1
firenze, Can you think of no one?,889,1
harry, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?,890,1
firenze, Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?,891,1
harry, The Philosopher's Stone.,892,1
environment,"Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.",893,1
hermione, Harry!,894,1

hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",899,1
harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}",900,1
ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?",901,1
harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.",902,1
ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!",903,1
hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,904,1

hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.",907,1
ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?",908,1
harry, My scar. It keeps burning.,909,1
hermione, It's happened before.,910,1
harry, Not like this.,911,1
ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.,912,1
harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}",913,1
hermione, What is it?,914,1
harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?",915,1
hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.,916,1
harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",917,1
hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",918,1
harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,919,1
hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",920,1
environment,The three gape.,921,1
hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!,922,1
environment,McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.,923,1
harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!",924,1
mcgonagall, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.,925,1
harry, He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.,926,1
mcgonagall, {shocked} How do you know,927,1
harry, Someone's going to try and steal it.,928,1
mcgonagall," I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}",929,1
environment,"After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.",930,1

environment,{Snape suddenly appears behind them},933,1
snape," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?",934,1

snape," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}",936,1
hermione, Now what do we do?,937,1
harry, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.,938,1

neville, No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.},944,1

hermione, Sorry.,949,1
ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}",950,1

ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.",956,1
harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.},957,1
ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!,958,1
harry, We have to move its paw.,959,1
ron, What?!,960,1
harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?",961,1
hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.,962,1
environment,Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.,963,1
ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}",964,1
harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.},965,1
ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.",966,1
harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.},967,1
hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.",968,1

harry, Apparently not.,984,1
ron, Help! Help me!,985,1
hermione, We've got to do something!,986,1
harry, What?,987,1
hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it!

ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!",1010,1

harry, Where are we? A graveyard.,1020,1
ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}",1021,1
harry, There's the door.,1022,1
environment,"They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.",1023,1
hermione, Now what do we do?,1024,1
ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}",1025,1
hermione, What happens now?,1026,1
ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}",1027,1
hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?",1028,1
ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!",1029,1

quirrell, I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.,1054,1
harry, Th-then you let the troll in.,1055,1
quirrell," Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire.

harry, Voldemort.,1069,1
voldemort," Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!",1070,1
environment,Harry turns and runs.,1071,1
voldemort, Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!,1072,1
harry, {shakes his head} Never!,1073,1

Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry.

dumbledore," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother.

harry, What is it?,1098,1
dumbledore," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.
