And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Certainly, Albus. As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs. Weasley's VOICE carries",1130,2

albus dumbledore,"First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?",1144,2

albus dumbledore,"Not intentionally, but... yes.",1149,2
harry,So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.,1150,2
albus dumbledore,"It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.",1151,2
harry,Only because I asked it to.,1152,2
albus dumbledore,"Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices. (smiling at him) If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this. Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. An ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.",1153,2

albus dumbledore,"Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. (a wry smile) Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.",1159,2
lucius malfoy,"From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.",1160,2

lucius malfoy,"Prove it! He turns away. As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching the diary in his hand, Harry mouths the words Open it. Dobby looks down curiously. Inside... is a SOCK. He GASPS.",1170,2
